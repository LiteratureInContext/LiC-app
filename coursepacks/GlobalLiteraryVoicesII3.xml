                  character "Crusoe," Defoe may be recalling his childhood schoolmate Timothy Cruso
                  (1656-1697), who would go on to a prominent career as a Presbyterian minister. The
                  name "Kreutznaer," from which Crusoe tells us his name is derived, is suggestive
                  of the Christian cross. And the fact that Crusoe lives his adult life with a name
                  other than that he was born with links him both to Defoe, who was born simply
                  Daniel Foe, and Alexander Selkirk, who was born Alexander Selcraig.</note> but by

               fill'd very early with rambling Thoughts: My Father, who was very ancient, had given
               me a competent Share of Learning, as far as House-Education, and a Country
               Free-School generally goes, and design'd me for the Law; but I would be satisfied
               with nothing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this
               led me so strongly against the Will, nay the Commands of my
               Father, and against all the Entreaties and Perswasions of my Mother and other
               Friends, that there seem'd to be something fatal in that Propension of Nature tending directly to the Life of Misery which was to befal me.</p>

               Prospect of raising my Fortunes by Application and Industry,
               with a Life of Ease and Pleasure. He told me it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on

               not embarass'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the

               Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being born to great
               things, and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes, between
               the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just
               Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither
               Poverty or Riches.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16">He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamities of Life were
               shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the middle Station had the
               fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower
               Part of Mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
               Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
               Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of
               Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Consequences of their Way of Living; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l2">That</hi> the middle Station of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues and all
               kinds of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plenty were the
               Hand-maids of a middle Fortune; that Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l4" n="4"/> Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all
               desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life; that
               this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out of it,
               not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life of
                  Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of
               Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret
               burning Lust of Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently
               thro' the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
               feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more
               sensibly.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18">After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play
               the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station
               of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity
               of seeking my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
               into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
               to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
               World, it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he should have
               nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
               warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word, that as he
               would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed,
               so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to
               give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder
               Brother for an Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him
               from going into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18l2" n="5"/> his young Desires
               prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not
               cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
               foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
               upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my
               Recovery.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l20">I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick, tho' I
               suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was
               kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me,
               he was so mov'd, that he broke off the Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full
               he could say no more to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22">I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise; and I
               resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
               Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any
               of my Father's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
               away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of
               Resolution prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
               pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
               seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to
               go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go
               without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which was <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l2" target="apprentice_" corresp="apprentice">too late to go Apprentice to a Trade.</ref>

               Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
               would go no more, and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I
               had lost.</p>

               my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt, and that she
                  wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a
               Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
               knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if I would ruine my self there was
               no Help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
               Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction;
               and I should never have it to say, that my Mother was willing when my Father was
               not.</p>

               if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent

               I went on Board a Ship bound for <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l16">London</hi>; never any young Adventurer's
               Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer

               manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was most
               inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
               leaving my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the
               good Counsel of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my
               Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
               Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since,
               reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God and my
               Father.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30">All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which I had never been upon before,
               went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like
               what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
               Sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I expected every Wave would have
               swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough
               or Hollow <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30l2" n="8"/> of the Sea, we should never rise more;
               and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolutions, that if it would please
               God here to spare my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land
               again, I would go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
               while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
               as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the
               middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days, and
               never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that

               Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine Evening
               follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having
               little or no Wind and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I
               thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.</p>

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44">Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young
               Sailor, and who had been in such a Fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this Distance the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l2" n="12"/> Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind upon
               Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned from them to the
               Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at Death it self; and these
               added to the Terror of the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no
               Words describe it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
               Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a
               good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every
               now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I
               did not know what they meant by Founder, till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so
                  violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
               the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their Prayers, and
               expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom.
               In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of of our Distresses, one of the
               Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another
               said there was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
               At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon
               the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
               me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
               at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this was
               doing, the Master seeing some light <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l4" target="collier_" corresp="collier">Colliers</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="collier" target="collier_" type="gloss">Coal barges</note>, who not able to ride out the
               Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near us, ordered to
               fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who knew nothing what that meant, was so
                  surprised, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l7" n="13"/> dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
               surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body had his
               own Life to think of, no Body minded me, or what was become of me; but another Man
               stept up to the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
               to my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46">We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent that the Ship
               would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible
               she could swim till we might run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for
               Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to
               help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible
               for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the
               Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a
               Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great Length, which
               they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we
               hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no Purpose
               for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, so
               all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
               Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd
               upon Shore <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46l2" target="makegood_" corresp="makegood">he would make it good to their

                  running aground, he would reimburse their master.</note>, so partly rowing and
               partly driving our Boat went away to the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46l5" target="norward_" corresp="norward">Norward</ref>

            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l48">We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship but we saw her sink,
               and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a Ship foundering in the
               Sea; I must acknowledge <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l48l2" n="14" facs="tcp:0653600100:18"/> I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she
               was sinking; for from that Moment they rather put me into
               the Boat than that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were dead within me,
               partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was yet
               before me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50">While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat
               near the Shore, we could see, when our Boat mounting the Waves, we were able to see
               the Shore, a great many People running along the Shore to assist us when we should
               come near, but we made but slow way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach the
               Shore, till being past the Light-House at <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l2">Winterton,</hi> the Shore falls off to the Westward towards <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l4">Cromer,</hi> and so
               the Land broke off a little the Violence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
                  without much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walk'd
               afterwards on Foot to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l6">Yarmouth,</hi> where, as unfortunate Men, we were used with great Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the
               Town, who assign'd us good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships,
               and had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l8">London</hi> or back to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l10">Hull,</hi> as we thought fit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52">Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l2">Hull,</hi> and have gone home, I had
               been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our Blessed Saviour's Parable, had even <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l4" target="calf_" corresp="calf">kill'd the fatted Calf for me</ref>

               hearing the Ship I went away in was cast away in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l7">Yarmouth</hi> Road, it was a
               great while before he had any Assurance that I was not drown'd.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l54">But my ill Fate push'd me on now with an Obstinacy that
               nothing could resist; and tho' I had several times loud
               Calls from my Reason and my more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l54l2" n="15"/> no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
               will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling Decree that hurries us on to be the
               Instruments of our own Destruction, even tho' it be before us, and that we rush upon
               it with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such
               decreed unavoidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape,
               could have push'd me forward against the calm Reasonings and Perswasions of my most
                  retired Thoughts, and against two such visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56">My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me before, and who was
               the Master's Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after we
               were at <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l2">Yarmouth,</hi> which was not till two or three Days, for we were
               separated in the Town to several Quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
               appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head,
               ask'd me how I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this Voyage
               only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me with a very
               grave and concern'd Tone, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l4">Young Man,</hi> says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l6">you ought never to go to

                  encountered by their ship.</note>. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l18">Pray,</hi> continues he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l20">what are you?
                  and on what Account did you go to Sea?</hi> Upon that I told him some of my Story;
               at the End of which he burst out with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done,
               says he, that such an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my
               Foot in <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l22" n="16"/> the same Ship with thee again for a
               Thousand Pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
               yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could have Authority
               to go. However he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
                  Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruine; told me I
               might see a visible Hand of Heaven against me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l24">And young Man,</hi> said he,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l26">depend upon it, if you do not go back, where-ever you go, you will meet with
                     nothing but Disasters and Disappointments till your

            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58">We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw him no more; which way
               he went, I know not. As for me, having some Money in my
               Pocket, I travelled to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58l2">London</hi> by Land; and there, as well as on the Road,
               had many Struggles with my self, what Course of Life I
               should take, and whether I should go Home, or go to Sea.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60">As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my Thoughts; and it
                  immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at
               among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not my Father and Mother only,
               but even every Body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous
               and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, especially
               of Youth, to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60l2">viz.</hi> That
               they are not asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
               asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62">In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures to take,
               and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home;
               and as I stay'd a while, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62l2" n="17"/> the Remembrance of the
               Distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in my
               Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts
               of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.</p>

                  character "Crusoe," Defoe may be recalling his childhood schoolmate Timothy Cruso
                  (1656-1697), who would go on to a prominent career as a Presbyterian minister. The
                  name "Kreutznaer," from which Crusoe tells us his name is derived, is suggestive
                  of the Christian cross. And the fact that Crusoe lives his adult life with a name
                  other than that he was born with links him both to Defoe, who was born simply
                  Daniel Foe, and Alexander Selkirk, who was born Alexander Selcraig.</note> but by

               fill'd very early with rambling Thoughts: My Father, who was very ancient, had given
               me a competent Share of Learning, as far as House-Education, and a Country
               Free-School generally goes, and design'd me for the Law; but I would be satisfied
               with nothing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this
               led me so strongly against the Will, nay the Commands of my
               Father, and against all the Entreaties and Perswasions of my Mother and other
               Friends, that there seem'd to be something fatal in that Propension of Nature tending directly to the Life of Misery which was to befal me.</p>

               with a Life of Ease and Pleasure. He told me it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on

               not embarass'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the

               Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being born to great
               things, and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes, between
               the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just
               Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither
               Poverty or Riches.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16">He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamities of Life were
               shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the middle Station had the
               fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower
               Part of Mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
               Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
               Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of
               Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Consequences of their Way of Living; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l2">That</hi> the middle Station of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues and all
               kinds of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plenty were the
               Hand-maids of a middle Fortune; that Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l4" n="4"/> Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all
               desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life; that
               this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out of it,
               not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life of
                  Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of
               Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret
               burning Lust of Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently
               thro' the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
               feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more
               sensibly.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18">After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play
               the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station
               of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity
               of seeking my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
               into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
               to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
               World, it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he should have
               nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
               warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word, that as he
               would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed,
               so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to
               give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder
               Brother for an Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him
               from going into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18l2" n="5"/> his young Desires
               prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not
               cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
               foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
               upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my
               Recovery.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l20">I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick, tho' I
               suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was
               kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me,
               he was so mov'd, that he broke off the Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full
               he could say no more to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22">I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise; and I
               resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
               Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any
               of my Father's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
               away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of
               Resolution prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
               pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
               seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to
               go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go
               without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which was <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l2" target="apprentice_" corresp="apprentice">too late to go Apprentice to a Trade.</ref>

               Attorney; that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l5" n="6"/> should certainly run away from my Master before my Time
               was out, and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go but one
               Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
               would go no more, and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I
               had lost.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l24">This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew it would be to no
               Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he knew too well what was
               my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt, and that she
                  wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a
               Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
               knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if I would ruine my self there was
               no Help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
               Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction;
               and I should never have it to say, that my Mother was willing when my Father was
               not.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l26">Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet as I
               have heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my Father,
               after shewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh, That Boy might be happy
               if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent
               to it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28">It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, tho' in the mean time I
               continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling to
               Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and Mother, about their being
               so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But

               manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was most
               inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
               leaving my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the
               good Counsel of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my
               Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
               Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since,
               reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God and my

               went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like
               what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
               Sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I expected every Wave would have
               swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough
               or Hollow <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30l2" n="8"/> of the Sea, we should never rise more;
               and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolutions, that if it would please
               God here to spare my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land
               again, I would go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
               while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
               as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the
               middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days, and
               never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that

               Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine Evening
               follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having
               little or no Wind and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I

               Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned from them to the
               Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at Death it self; and these
               added to the Terror of the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no
               Words describe it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
               Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a
               good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every
               now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I
               did not know what they meant by Founder, till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so
                  violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
               the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their Prayers, and
               expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom.
               In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of of our Distresses, one of the
               Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another
               said there was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
               At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon
               the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
               me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
               at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this was

               Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near us, ordered to
               fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who knew nothing what that meant, was so
                  surprised, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l7" n="13"/> dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
               surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body had his
               own Life to think of, no Body minded me, or what was become of me; but another Man
               stept up to the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
               to my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46">We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent that the Ship
               would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible
               she could swim till we might run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for
               Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to
               help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible
               for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the

               Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great Length, which
               they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we
               hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no Purpose
               for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, so
               all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
               Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l48">We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship but we saw her sink,
               and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a Ship foundering in the
               Sea; I must acknowledge <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l48l2" n="14" facs="tcp:0653600100:18"/> I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she
               was sinking; for from that Moment they rather put me into
               the Boat than that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were dead within me,
               partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was yet
               before me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50">While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat
               near the Shore, we could see, when our Boat mounting the Waves, we were able to see
               the Shore, a great many People running along the Shore to assist us when we should
               come near, but we made but slow way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach the
               Shore, till being past the Light-House at <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l2">Winterton,</hi> the Shore falls off to the Westward towards <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l4">Cromer,</hi> and so
               the Land broke off a little the Violence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
                  without much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walk'd
               afterwards on Foot to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l6">Yarmouth,</hi> where, as unfortunate Men, we were used with great Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the
               Town, who assign'd us good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships,
               and had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l8">London</hi> or back to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l50l10">Hull,</hi> as we thought fit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52">Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l2">Hull,</hi> and have gone home, I had
               been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our Blessed Saviour's Parable, had even <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l4" target="calf_" corresp="calf">kill'd the fatted Calf for me</ref>

               hearing the Ship I went away in was cast away in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l52l7">Yarmouth</hi> Road, it was a
               great while before he had any Assurance that I was not drown'd.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l54">But my ill Fate push'd me on now with an Obstinacy that
               nothing could resist; and tho' I had several times loud
               Calls from my Reason and my more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l54l2" n="15"/> no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
               will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling Decree that hurries us on to be the
               Instruments of our own Destruction, even tho' it be before us, and that we rush upon
               it with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such
               decreed unavoidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape,
               could have push'd me forward against the calm Reasonings and Perswasions of my most
                  retired Thoughts, and against two such visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56">My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me before, and who was
               the Master's Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after we
               were at <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l2">Yarmouth,</hi> which was not till two or three Days, for we were
               separated in the Town to several Quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
               appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head,
               ask'd me how I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this Voyage
               only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me with a very
               grave and concern'd Tone, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l4">Young Man,</hi> says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l6">you ought never to go to

                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l8">That is another Case,</hi> said he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l10">it is my Calling, and therefore my
                  Duty; but as you made this Voyage for a Trial, you see what a Taste Heaven has

                  but was thrown overboard and swallowed by a whale when the crew discovered that he
                  was fleeing God's commandment, and held him responsible for the violent storms
                  encountered by their ship.</note>. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l18">Pray,</hi> continues he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l20">what are you?
                  and on what Account did you go to Sea?</hi> Upon that I told him some of my Story;
               at the End of which he burst out with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done,
               says he, that such an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my
               Foot in <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l22" n="16"/> the same Ship with thee again for a
               Thousand Pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
               yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could have Authority
               to go. However he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
                  Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruine; told me I
               might see a visible Hand of Heaven against me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l24">And young Man,</hi> said he,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l26">depend upon it, if you do not go back, where-ever you go, you will meet with
                     nothing but Disasters and Disappointments till your
                  Father's Words are fulfilled upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58">We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw him no more; which way
               he went, I know not. As for me, having some Money in my
               Pocket, I travelled to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58l2">London</hi> by Land; and there, as well as on the Road,
               had many Struggles with my self, what Course of Life I
               should take, and whether I should go Home, or go to Sea.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60">As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my Thoughts; and it
                  immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at
               among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not my Father and Mother only,
               but even every Body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous
               and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, especially
               of Youth, to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60l2">viz.</hi> That
               they are not asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
               asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62">In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures to take,
               and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home;
               and as I stay'd a while, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62l2" n="17"/> the Remembrance of the
               Distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in my
               Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts
               of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.</p>

                  character "Crusoe," Defoe may be recalling his childhood schoolmate Timothy Cruso
                  (1656-1697), who would go on to a prominent career as a Presbyterian minister. The
                  name "Kreutznaer," from which Crusoe tells us his name is derived, is suggestive
                  of the Christian cross. And the fact that Crusoe lives his adult life with a name

               the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just
               Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16">He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamities of Life were
               shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the middle Station had the
               fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower
               Part of Mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
               Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
               Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of

               desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life; that
               this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out of it,
               not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life of
                  Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of
               Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret
               burning Lust of Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently
               thro' the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
               feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more
               sensibly.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18">After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play
               the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station
               of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity
               of seeking my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
               into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
               to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
               World, it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he should have
               nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
               warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word, that as he
               would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed,
               so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to
               give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder
               Brother for an Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him
               from going into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18l2" n="5"/> his young Desires
               prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not
               cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
               foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
               upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my
               Recovery.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l20">I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick, tho' I
               suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was
               kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me,
               he was so mov'd, that he broke off the Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full
               he could say no more to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22">I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise; and I
               resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
               Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any
               of my Father's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
               away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of
               Resolution prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
               pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
               seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to
               go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go
               without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which was <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l2" target="apprentice_" corresp="apprentice">too late to go Apprentice to a Trade.</ref>

               was out, and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go but one
               Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
               would go no more, and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I
               had lost.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l24">This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew it would be to no
               Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he knew too well what was
               my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt, and that she
                  wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a
               Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
               knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if I would ruine my self there was
               no Help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
               Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction;
               and I should never have it to say, that my Mother was willing when my Father was
               not.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l26">Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet as I
               have heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my Father,
               after shewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh, That Boy might be happy
               if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent
               to it.</p>

               continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling to

               so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But

               hear of it as they might, without asking God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any
                  Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences, and in an
               ill Hour, God knows. On the first of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l14">September</hi> 1661
               I went on Board a Ship bound for <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l16">London</hi>; never any young Adventurer's
               Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer
               than mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out of the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l18">Humber,</hi> but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to rise in a most frightful
               manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was most
               inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
               leaving my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the
               good Counsel of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my
               Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
               Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since,
               reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God and my
               Father.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30">All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which I had never been upon before,
               went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like
               what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
               Sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I expected every Wave would have
               swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough
               or Hollow <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30l2" n="8"/> of the Sea, we should never rise more;
               and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolutions, that if it would please
               God here to spare my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land
               again, I would go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
               while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
               as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the
               middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days, and
               never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that

               follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having

               that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance, all
               my Reflections upon my past Conduct, and all my Resolutions for my future. In a word,
               as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of Surface and
               settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm, so the Hurry of my Thoughts being
               over, my Fears and Apprehensions of being swallow'd up by the Sea being forgotten,
               and the Current of my former Desires return'd, I entirely forgot the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l34l12" target="vows_" corresp="vows">Vows and Promises</ref>

               my Distress. I found indeed some Intervals of Reflection, and the serious Thoughts
               did, as it were endeavour to return again sometimes, but I
               shook them off, and rouz'd my self from them as it were from a Distemper, and applying my self to Drink and Company, soon master'd the Return of those Fits, for so I
               call'd them, and I had in five or six Days got as compleat a Victory over Conscience
               as any young, Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with it, could desire: But I
               was to have another Trial for it still; and Providence, as in such Cases generally it
               does, resolv'd to leave me entirely without Excuse. For if I would not take this for
               a Deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most Wretch among us
               would confess both the harden'd Danger and the Mercy.</p>

               Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned from them to the
               Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at Death it self; and these
               added to the Terror of the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no
               Words describe it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
               Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a
               good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every
               now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I
               did not know what they meant by Founder, till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so
                  violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
               the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their Prayers, and
               expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom.
               In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of of our Distresses, one of the
               Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another
               said there was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
               At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon
               the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
               me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
               at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this was
               doing, the Master seeing some light <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l4" target="collier_" corresp="collier">Colliers</ref>

               Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near us, ordered to
               fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who knew nothing what that meant, was so
                  surprised, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l7" n="13"/> dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
               surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body had his
               own Life to think of, no Body minded me, or what was become of me; but another Man
               stept up to the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
               to my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46">We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent that the Ship
               would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible
               she could swim till we might run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for
               Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to
               help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible
               for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the
               Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a
               Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great Length, which
               they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we
               hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no Purpose
               for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, so
               all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
               Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd

               were at <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l2">Yarmouth,</hi> which was not till two or three Days, for we were
               separated in the Town to several Quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
               appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head,
               ask'd me how I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this Voyage
               only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me with a very
               grave and concern'd Tone, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l4">Young Man,</hi> says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l6">you ought never to go to

                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l8">That is another Case,</hi> said he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l10">it is my Calling, and therefore my
                  Duty; but as you made this Voyage for a Trial, you see what a Taste Heaven has
                  given you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen

                  but was thrown overboard and swallowed by a whale when the crew discovered that he
                  was fleeing God's commandment, and held him responsible for the violent storms
                  encountered by their ship.</note>. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l18">Pray,</hi> continues he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l20">what are you?
                  and on what Account did you go to Sea?</hi> Upon that I told him some of my Story;
               at the End of which he burst out with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done,
               says he, that such an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my
               Foot in <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l22" n="16"/> the same Ship with thee again for a
               Thousand Pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
               yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could have Authority
               to go. However he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
                  Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruine; told me I
               might see a visible Hand of Heaven against me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l24">And young Man,</hi> said he,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l56l26">depend upon it, if you do not go back, where-ever you go, you will meet with
                     nothing but Disasters and Disappointments till your
                  Father's Words are fulfilled upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58">We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw him no more; which way
               he went, I know not. As for me, having some Money in my
               Pocket, I travelled to <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l58l2">London</hi> by Land; and there, as well as on the Road,
               had many Struggles with my self, what Course of Life I
               should take, and whether I should go Home, or go to Sea.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60">As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my Thoughts; and it
                  immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at
               among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not my Father and Mother only,
               but even every Body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous
               and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, especially
               of Youth, to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l60l2">viz.</hi> That
               they are not asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
               asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62">In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures to take,
               and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home;
               and as I stay'd a while, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62l2" n="17"/> the Remembrance of the
               Distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in my
               Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts
               of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.</p>

                  character "Crusoe," Defoe may be recalling his childhood schoolmate Timothy Cruso
                  (1656-1697), who would go on to a prominent career as a Presbyterian minister. The
                  name "Kreutznaer," from which Crusoe tells us his name is derived, is suggestive
                  of the Christian cross. And the fact that Crusoe lives his adult life with a name
                  other than that he was born with links him both to Defoe, who was born simply
                  Daniel Foe, and Alexander Selkirk, who was born Alexander Selcraig.</note> but by

               Happiness of this State, by this one thing, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l14l18">viz.</hi> That this was the State of
               Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being born to great
               things, and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes, between
               the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just
               Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither
               Poverty or Riches.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16">He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamities of Life were
               shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the middle Station had the
               fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower
               Part of Mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
               Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
               Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of
               Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Consequences of their Way of Living; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l2">That</hi> the middle Station of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues and all
               kinds of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plenty were the
               Hand-maids of a middle Fortune; that Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l16l4" n="4"/> Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all
               desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life; that
               this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out of it,
               not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life of
                  Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of
               Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret
               burning Lust of Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently
               thro' the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
               feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more
               sensibly.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18">After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play
               the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station
               of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity
               of seeking my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
               into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
               to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
               World, it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he should have
               nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
               warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word, that as he
               would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed,
               so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to
               give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder
               Brother for an Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him
               from going into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l18l2" n="5"/> his young Desires
               prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not
               cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
               foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
               upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my
               Recovery.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l20">I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick, tho' I
               suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was
               kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me,
               he was so mov'd, that he broke off the Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full
               he could say no more to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22">I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise; and I
               resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
               Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any
               of my Father's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
               away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of
               Resolution prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
               pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
               seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to
               go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go
               without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which was <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l2" target="apprentice_" corresp="apprentice">too late to go Apprentice to a Trade.</ref>

               Attorney; that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l22l5" n="6"/> should certainly run away from my Master before my Time
               was out, and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go but one
               Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
               would go no more, and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I
               had lost.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l24">This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew it would be to no
               Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he knew too well what was
               my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt, and that she
                  wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a
               Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
               knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if I would ruine my self there was
               no Help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
               Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction;
               and I should never have it to say, that my Mother was willing when my Father was
               not.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l26">Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet as I
               have heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my Father,
               after shewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh, That Boy might be happy
               if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent
               to it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28">It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, tho' in the mean time I
               continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling to
               Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and Mother, about their being
               so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But

               should cost me nothing for my Passage, I consulted neither Father or Mother any more,
               nor so much as sent them Word of it; but leaving them to
               hear of it as they might, without asking God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any
                  Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences, and in an
               ill Hour, God knows. On the first of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l14">September</hi> 1661
               I went on Board a Ship bound for <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l16">London</hi>; never any young Adventurer's
               Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer
               than mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out of the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l28l18">Humber,</hi> but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to rise in a most frightful
               manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was most
               inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
               leaving my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the
               good Counsel of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my
               Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
               Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since,
               reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God and my
               Father.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30">All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which I had never been upon before,
               went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like
               what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
               Sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I expected every Wave would have
               swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough
               or Hollow <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l30l2" n="8"/> of the Sea, we should never rise more;
               and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolutions, that if it would please
               God here to spare my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land
               again, I would go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
               while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
               as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the
               middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days, and
               never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that

               some time after; but the next Day the Wind was abated and

               was very grave for all that Day, being also a little Sea sick still; but towards
               Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine Evening
               follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having
               little or no Wind and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I
               thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l34">I had slept well in the Night, and was now no more Sea sick but very chearful,
               looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough and terrible the Day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time after.
               And now least my good Resolutions should continue, my Companion, who had indeed

               call'd them, and I had in five or six Days got as compleat a Victory over Conscience
               as any young, Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with it, could desire: But I
               was to have another Trial for it still; and Providence, as in such Cases generally it

               Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned from them to the
               Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at Death it self; and these
               added to the Terror of the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no
               Words describe it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
               Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a
               good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every
               now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I
               did not know what they meant by Founder, till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so
                  violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
               the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their Prayers, and
               expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom.
               In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of of our Distresses, one of the
               Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another
               said there was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
               At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon
               the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
               me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
               at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this was
               doing, the Master seeing some light <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l4" target="collier_" corresp="collier">Colliers</ref>

               Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near us, ordered to
               fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who knew nothing what that meant, was so
                  surprised, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l44l7" n="13"/> dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
               surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body had his
               own Life to think of, no Body minded me, or what was become of me; but another Man
               stept up to the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
               to my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46">We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent that the Ship
               would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible
               she could swim till we might run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for
               Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to
               help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible
               for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the
               Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a
               Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great Length, which
               they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we
               hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no Purpose
               for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, so
               all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
               Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd
               upon Shore <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l46l2" target="makegood_" corresp="makegood">he would make it good to their

               was sinking; for from that Moment they rather put me into

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62">In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures to take,
               and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home;
               and as I stay'd a while, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l62l2" n="17"/> the Remembrance of the
               Distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in my
               Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts
               of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.</p>

               Dinner; there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole Island; I had the Lives
               of all my Subjects at my absolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take
               it away, and no Rebels among all my Sublects.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1000">Then to see how like a King I din'd too all alone, attended by my Servants,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1000l2">Poll,</hi> as if he had been my Favourite, was the only Person permitted to
               talk to me. My Dog who was now grown very old and <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1000l4" target="crazy_" corresp="crazy">crazy</ref>

               Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat always at my Right Hand, and two Cats, one on
               one Side the Table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a Bit from my Hand,
               as a Mark of special Favour.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1002">But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first, for they were both
               of them dead, and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my own Hand; but one of
               them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I
               had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest run wild in the Woods, and became indeed
               troublesom to me at last; for they would often come into my House, and plunder me
               too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length
               they left me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful
               Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
               but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like
               to have too much.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l2" n="176"/>I was something impatient, as I have observ'd,
               to have the Use of my Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore
               sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I sat
               my self down contented enough without her. But I had a
               strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have
               said, in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the
               Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd upon me
               every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge of the Shore, I did so: But had any one in
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l4">England</hi> been to meet such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted
               them, or rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
               my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l6">Yorkshire</hi> with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd to take
               a Scetch of my Figure as follows,</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1006">I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down
               behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to shoot the Rain off from running into
               my Neck; nothing being so hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain upon the Flesh under
               the Cloaths.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1008">I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to
               about the middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the same, the
               Breeches were made of the Skin of an old <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1008l2">He-goat,</hi> whose Hair hung down such

               all the rest of my Cloaths.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1010">I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dry'd, which I drew together with two <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1010l2" target="thong_" corresp="thong">Thongs</ref>

                  attached to a belt, designed to hold a sword or bayonet</note> on either Side of

               Side, one on the other. I had another Belt not so broad, and fasten'd in the same
               Manner, which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it, under my left Arm, hung
               two Pouches, both made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung my Powder, in the
               other my Shot: At my Back I carry'd my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my
               Head a great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which,
               after all, was the most necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my

               Whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my Hat upon them; but they
               were of a Length and Shape monstrous enough, and such as in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1010l28">England</hi> would
               have pass'd for frightful.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012">But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe me, that it
               was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part. In this kind of
               Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along
               the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012l2" n="178"/> Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I
               first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now
               to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the
               same Height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks
               which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I
               was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Current,
               any more there than in other Places.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014">I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some Time in the
               observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l2">viz.</hi> That the Tide of Ebb setting from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l4">West,</hi> and joyning
               with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion
               of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l6">West,</hi> or from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l8">North,</hi> this Current came nearer, or went
               farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock
               again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther of, being near half a League
               from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd me and
               my <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l10">Canoe</hi> along with it, which at another Time it would not have done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016">This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but
               to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my
               Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of
               putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
               Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience; but on
               the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l2" n="179"/> though more laborious; and this was, That I would
               build, or rather make me another <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l4">Periagau</hi> or <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l6">Canoe</hi>; and so have one
               for one Side of the Island, and one for the other.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1018">You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations in the
               Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about it under the Rock,
               with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments,
               or Caves, one within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest, and
               had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say, beyond where my Wall
               joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have
               given an Account, and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five
               or six Bushels each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some
               in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with my Hand.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020">As for my Wall made, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020l2">as before,</hi> with long Stakes or Piles, those Piles grew
               all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
               there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind
               them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1022">Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and upon lower
               Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd, and
               which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for
               more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024">Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation there
               also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair;
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l2">that is to say,</hi> I kept the Hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted
               up to its usual Height, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l4" n="180"/> the Ladder standing
               always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes,
               but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might
               spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did
               effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for
               that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
               made me a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l6" target="squab_" corresp="squab">Squab</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="squab" target="squab_" type="gloss">A
                  cushion forming part of the inside fittings of a carriage</note> or Couch, with
               the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd, and with other soft
               Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had
               saved, and a great Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
               absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1026">Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say, my Goats: And as
               I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
               lest the Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour I
               had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near to one
               another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a
               Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in
               the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed stronger than
               any Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028">This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains to bring to
               pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame
               Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
               Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028l2" n="181"/> for me as
               long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in
               my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures
               to such a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by this Method
                  indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick,
               I was forced to pull some of them up again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1030">In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my
               Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet; and
               indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032">As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation,
               and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in my Way
               thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all Things about or
               belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out in her to divert my self,
               but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032l2" target="stonecast_" corresp="stonecast">Stone's Cast</ref>

               Shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out of my
               Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034">It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd
               with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in
               the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition; I
               listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any Thing, I went up to a
               rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all
               one, I could see no other <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034l2" n="182"/> Impression but that
               one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not
               be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for there was exactly the very Print of
               a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor
               could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man
               perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling,
               as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me
               at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it
               possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
               Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
               in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the
               Way.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1036">When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this, I fled into it
               like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a
               Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never
               frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to this
               Retreat.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038">I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright, the
               greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary
               to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
               Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful
               Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it
               must be the Devil; and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this
                  Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l2" n="183"/> Shape come into
               the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there of any other
               Footsteps? And how was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l4">Satan</hi> should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could
               be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and
               that even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an
               Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
               of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot. That as I
               liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island, he would never have been so simple to
               leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the Sand too, which the first Surge of the
               Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with
               the Thing it self, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of
               the Devil.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040">Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out
               of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it
               must be some more dangerous Creature, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l2">viz.</hi>) That it must be some of the
               Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in their
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l4">Canoes</hi>; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds had <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l6" target="arrived_" corresp="arrived">made</ref>

               Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stay'd in this desolate
               Island, as I would have been to have had them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1042">While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful in my
               Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they did
               not see my Boat, by which they would have concluded that some Inhabitants <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1042l2" n="182"/>

               search'd farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their
               having found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should
               certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
               happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my Enclosure, destroy all
               my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should
                  perish at last for meer Want.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1044">Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence in God which
               was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness, now
               vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
               Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness. I reproach'd my self
               with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me
               till the next Season, as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
               Crop that was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
               for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand,
               so that whatever might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.</p>

               fear; nay even tremble at the Apprehensions of; this was exemplify'd in me at this
               Time in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was, that I
               seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
               Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l5" n="185"/> to what I call'd silent Life; that I was as one who
               Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living,
               or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my own
               Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
               Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation, could
               bestow; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l7">I say,</hi> that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing
               a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance
               of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1048">Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many curious
               Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my
               first Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise
               and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could not foresee what
               the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his
               Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern
               and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as
               I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my
               Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd against him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1050">I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had
               thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he
               did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely
               and entirely to his Will; and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him,
               pray to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
               Providence.</p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l2" n="186"/>These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days;
               nay, I may say, Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect
               of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I cannot omit, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l4">viz.</hi> One Morning early,
               lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of
               Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which
               those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l6" target="psalm50_" corresp="psalm50">Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054">Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted, but I
               was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
               first Words that presented to me, were, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054l2" target="psalms_" corresp="psalms">Wait

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1056">In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and

               might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me
               up a little too, and I began to perswade my self it was all
               a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and
               why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I
               could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if
               at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part of those Fools,
               who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted at
               them more than any body.</p>

               abroad again; for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so
               that I began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but
               some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
                  usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures
               were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd
               some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1060">Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of

               again, and went to my Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I
               went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay
               down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was
                  haunted with an evil Conscience, or that I had been

               fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a
               Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to

               again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in
               short, that the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course to take for my Security I

               there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any

               above: Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more
               terrifying than Danger it self, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
               anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that Relief in this
               Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I
               thought, like <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l2" target="philistines_" corresp="philistines">Saul,</ref> who
               complain'd not only that the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l4">Philistines</hi> were upon him; but that God had
               forsaken him <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="philistines" target="philistines_" type="gloss">Saul, the first king of the Israelites, summons
                  the spirit of the prophet Samuel and tells him, "I am sore distressed; for the
                  Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no
                  more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams" (1 Samuel 28:15).</note>; for I did not
               now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by crying to God in my Distress, and resting
               upon his Providence, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l8" n="189"/>
               as I had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, at
               least, been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1068">This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning I fell
               asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were, tyr'd, and my
               Spirits exhausted; I slept very soundly, and wak'd much
               better compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately; and
               upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so
               exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen,
               was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
               altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet that there might
               sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with Design, or perhaps never,
               but when they were driven by cross Winds, might come to this Place.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1070">That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least Shadow or
               Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should be driven here, it was
               probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
               thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion, to this Time.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072">That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual accidental
               Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely if they were driven
               hither, were here against their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again
               with all possible Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, least they should not
               have the Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and that therefore I had
               nothing to do but to consider <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072l2" n="190"/> of some safe
               Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the
               Spot.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1074">Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to bring a Door
               through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where
               my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore, I
               resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double
               Row of Trees, about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles
               to be driven between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall
               would be soon finish'd.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1076">So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickned with Pieces of
               Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to
               make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put my Arm
               out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick, with
               continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
               walking upon it; and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of
               which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I
               planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
               that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time:
               This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe
               till it was done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078">When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great way every
               way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l2" target="osier_" corresp="osier">Osier</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="osier" target="osier_" type="gloss">A variety of Eurasian willows</note> like Wood, which I found so apt
               to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l5" n="191"/> twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty
               large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an Enemy, and
               they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted to approach my
               outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1080">Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood
               before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed
               perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a
               Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left
               no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which was low,
               and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that; so when the two
               Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to me without mischieving
                  himself; and if they had come down, they were still on
               the Out-side of my outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1082">Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation;
               and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether without just Reason;
               though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1084">While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my
               other Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they
               were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion,
               and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also
               without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the
               Advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086">To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two Ways to preserve
               them; <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086l2" n="192"/> one was to find another convenient
               Place to dig a a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the
               other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another and as
               much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each
               Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
               raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this,
               tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I
               thought was the most rational Design.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1088">Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of the Island; and I
               pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart
               could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and
               thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once before, endeavouring to come back that Way from the Eastern
               Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so
                  surrounded with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by
               Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour to make
               it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1090">I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than a Month's
               Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which you please, who
               were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this
               Piece; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it
               as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more
               Time by a great deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l2" n="193"/>All this Labour I was at the Expence of,
               purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had
               seen; for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now
               liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made
               my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who
               know what it is to live in the constant Snare of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l4">the Fear of Man</hi>; and this I
               must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my
               Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part
               of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom
               found my self in a due Temper for <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l6" target="supplication_" corresp="supplication">Application to my Maker</ref>

               Night of being murther'd and devour'd before Morning; and I must testify from my

               Dinner; there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole Island; I had the Lives
               of all my Subjects at my absolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take
               it away, and no Rebels among all my Sublects.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1000">Then to see how like a King I din'd too all alone, attended by my Servants,

               Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat always at my Right Hand, and two Cats, one on
               one Side the Table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a Bit from my Hand,
               as a Mark of special Favour.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1002">But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first, for they were both
               of them dead, and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my own Hand; but one of
               them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I
               had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest run wild in the Woods, and became indeed
               troublesom to me at last; for they would often come into my House, and plunder me
               too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length
               they left me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful
               Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
               but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like
               to have too much.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l2" n="176"/>I was something impatient, as I have observ'd,
               to have the Use of my Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore
               sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I sat
               my self down contented enough without her. But I had a
               strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have
               said, in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the
               Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd upon me
               every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge of the Shore, I did so: But had any one in
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l4">England</hi> been to meet such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted
               them, or rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
               my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l6">Yorkshire</hi> with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd to take

               Manner, which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it, under my left Arm, hung
               two Pouches, both made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung my Powder, in the
               other my Shot: At my Back I carry'd my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my
               Head a great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which,
               after all, was the most necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my

               have pass'd for frightful.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012">But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe me, that it
               was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part. In this kind of
               Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along
               the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012l2" n="178"/> Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I
               first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now
               to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the
               same Height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks
               which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I
               was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Current,
               any more there than in other Places.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014">I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some Time in the
               observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l2">viz.</hi> That the Tide of Ebb setting from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l4">West,</hi> and joyning
               with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion
               of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l6">West,</hi> or from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l8">North,</hi> this Current came nearer, or went
               farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock
               again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther of, being near half a League
               from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd me and
               my <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l10">Canoe</hi> along with it, which at another Time it would not have done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016">This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but
               to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my
               Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of
               putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
               Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience; but on
               the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l2" n="179"/> though more laborious; and this was, That I would
               build, or rather make me another <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l4">Periagau</hi> or <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l6">Canoe</hi>; and so have one
               for one Side of the Island, and one for the other.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1018">You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations in the
               Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about it under the Rock,
               with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments,
               or Caves, one within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest, and
               had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say, beyond where my Wall
               joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have
               given an Account, and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five
               or six Bushels each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some
               in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with my Hand.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020">As for my Wall made, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020l2">as before,</hi> with long Stakes or Piles, those Piles grew
               all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
               there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind
               them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1022">Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and upon lower
               Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd, and
               which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for
               more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024">Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation there
               also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair;
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l2">that is to say,</hi> I kept the Hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted
               up to its usual Height, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l4" n="180"/> the Ladder standing
               always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes,
               but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might
               spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did
               effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for
               that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
               made me a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l6" target="squab_" corresp="squab">Squab</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="squab" target="squab_" type="gloss">A
                  cushion forming part of the inside fittings of a carriage</note> or Couch, with
               the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd, and with other soft
               Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had
               saved, and a great Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
               absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1026">Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say, my Goats: And as
               I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
               lest the Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour I
               had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near to one
               another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a
               Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in
               the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed stronger than
               any Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028">This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains to bring to
               pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame
               Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
               Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028l2" n="181"/> for me as
               long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in
               my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures
               to such a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by this Method
                  indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick,
               I was forced to pull some of them up again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1030">In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my
               Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet; and
               indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032">As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation,
               and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in my Way
               thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all Things about or
               belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out in her to divert my self,
               but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032l2" target="stonecast_" corresp="stonecast">Stone's Cast</ref>

               Shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out of my
               Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034">It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd
               with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in
               the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition; I
               listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any Thing, I went up to a
               rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all
               one, I could see no other <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034l2" n="182"/> Impression but that
               one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not
               be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for there was exactly the very Print of
               a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor
               could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man
               perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling,
               as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me
               at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it
               possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
               Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
               in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the
               Way.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1036">When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this, I fled into it
               like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a
               Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never
               frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to this
               Retreat.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038">I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright, the
               greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary
               to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
               Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful
               Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it
               must be the Devil; and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this
                  Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l2" n="183"/> Shape come into
               the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there of any other
               Footsteps? And how was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l4">Satan</hi> should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could
               be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and
               that even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an
               Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
               of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot. That as I
               liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island, he would never have been so simple to
               leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the Sand too, which the first Surge of the
               Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with
               the Thing it self, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of
               the Devil.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040">Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out
               of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it
               must be some more dangerous Creature, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l2">viz.</hi>) That it must be some of the
               Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in their
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l4">Canoes</hi>; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds had <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l6" target="arrived_" corresp="arrived">made</ref>

               Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stay'd in this desolate
               Island, as I would have been to have had them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1042">While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful in my
               Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they did
               not see my Boat, by which they would have concluded that some Inhabitants <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1042l2" n="182"/>

               search'd farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their
               having found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should
               certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
               happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my Enclosure, destroy all
               my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should
                  perish at last for meer Want.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1044">Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence in God which
               was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness, now
               vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
               Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness. I reproach'd my self
               with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me
               till the next Season, as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
               Crop that was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
               for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand,
               so that whatever might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.</p>

               differing Springs are the Affections hurry'd about as differing Circumstance present! To Day we love what to Morrow we hate; to Day we seek
               what to Morrow we shun; to Day we desire what to Morrow we
               fear; nay even tremble at the Apprehensions of; this was exemplify'd in me at this
               Time in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was, that I
               seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
               Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l5" n="185"/> to what I call'd silent Life; that I was as one who
               Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living,
               or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my own
               Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
               Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation, could
               bestow; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l7">I say,</hi> that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing
               a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance
               of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1048">Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many curious
               Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my
               first Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise
               and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could not foresee what
               the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his
               Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern
               and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as
               I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my
               Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd against him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1050">I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had
               thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he
               did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely
               and entirely to his Will; and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him,
               pray to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
               Providence.</p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l2" n="186"/>These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days;
               nay, I may say, Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect
               of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I cannot omit, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l4">viz.</hi> One Morning early,
               lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of
               Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which
               those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l6" target="psalm50_" corresp="psalm50">Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054">Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted, but I
               was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
               first Words that presented to me, were, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054l2" target="psalms_" corresp="psalms">Wait
                  on the Lord, and be of good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart; wait, I say,

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1056">In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and

               might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me
               up a little too, and I began to perswade my self it was all
               a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and
               why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I
               could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if
               at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part of those Fools,
               who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted at
               them more than any body.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1058">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1058l2" n="187"/>Now I began to take Courage, and to peep
               abroad again; for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so
               that I began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but
               some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
                  usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures
               were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd
               some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1060">Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of
               one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1060l2" target="start_" corresp="start">start</ref>

               again, and went to my Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I
               went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay
               down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was
                  haunted with an evil Conscience, or that I had been
                  lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062">However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen nothing, I began to
               be a little bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
               it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not perswade my self
               fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a
               Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to
               the Place, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062l2">First,</hi> It appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid up my Boat,
               I could not possibly be on Shore any where there about. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062l4">Secondly,</hi> When I
               came to measure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
               not so large by a great deal; both these Things fill'd my Head with new Imaginations,
               and gave me <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062l6" target="humors2_" corresp="humors2">the Vapours</ref>

                  illness.</note> again, to the highest Degree; so that I <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062l9" n="188"/> shook with cold, like one in an Ague: And I went Home
               again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in
               short, that the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course to take for my Security I
               knew not.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1064">O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear! It deprives them of
               the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief. The first Thing I
               propos'd to my self, was, to throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle
               wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island
               in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the
               simple Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find such a Grain
               there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any
               Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
               Persons inhabiting.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066">These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation,
               after I was come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind
               were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as
               above: Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more
               terrifying than Danger it self, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
               anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that Relief in this
               Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I
               thought, like <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l2" target="philistines_" corresp="philistines">Saul,</ref> who
               complain'd not only that the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l4">Philistines</hi> were upon him; but that God had
               forsaken him <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="philistines" target="philistines_" type="gloss">Saul, the first king of the Israelites, summons
                  the spirit of the prophet Samuel and tells him, "I am sore distressed; for the

                  more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams" (1 Samuel 28:15).</note>; for I did not
               now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by crying to God in my Distress, and resting
               upon his Providence, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066l8" n="189"/>
               as I had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, at
               least, been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1068">This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning I fell
               asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were, tyr'd, and my
               Spirits exhausted; I slept very soundly, and wak'd much
               better compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately; and
               upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so
               exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen,
               was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
               altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet that there might
               sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with Design, or perhaps never,
               but when they were driven by cross Winds, might come to this Place.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1070">That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least Shadow or
               Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should be driven here, it was
               probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
               thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion, to this Time.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072">That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual accidental
               Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely if they were driven
               hither, were here against their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again
               with all possible Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, least they should not
               have the Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and that therefore I had
               nothing to do but to consider <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072l2" n="190"/> of some safe
               Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the
               Spot.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1074">Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to bring a Door
               through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where
               my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore, I
               resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double
               Row of Trees, about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles
               to be driven between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall
               would be soon finish'd.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1076">So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickned with Pieces of
               Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to
               make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put my Arm
               out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick, with
               continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
               walking upon it; and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of
               which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I
               planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
               that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time:
               This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe
               till it was done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078">When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great way every
               way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l2" target="osier_" corresp="osier">Osier</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="osier" target="osier_" type="gloss">A variety of Eurasian willows</note> like Wood, which I found so apt
               to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l5" n="191"/> twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty
               large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an Enemy, and
               they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted to approach my
               outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1080">Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood
               before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed
               perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a
               Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left
               no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which was low,
               and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that; so when the two
               Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to me without mischieving
                  himself; and if they had come down, they were still on
               the Out-side of my outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1082">Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation;
               and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether without just Reason;
               though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1084">While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my
               other Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they
               were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion,
               and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also
               without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the
               Advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086">To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two Ways to preserve
               them; <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086l2" n="192"/> one was to find another convenient
               Place to dig a a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the
               other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another and as
               much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each
               Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
               raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this,
               tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I
               thought was the most rational Design.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1088">Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of the Island; and I
               pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart
               could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and
               thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once before, endeavouring to come back that Way from the Eastern
               Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so
                  surrounded with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by
               Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour to make
               it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1090">I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than a Month's
               Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which you please, who
               were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this
               Piece; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it
               as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more
               Time by a great deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l2" n="193"/>All this Labour I was at the Expence of,
               purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had
               seen; for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now
               liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made
               my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who
               know what it is to live in the constant Snare of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l4">the Fear of Man</hi>; and this I
               must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my
               Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part
               of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom

               twentieth Year of my first setting Foot in this Island of
               Solitariness; I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health, had no
               Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any Uneasiness of Mind, more than
               ordinary; but could by no means close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a
               Wink all Night long, otherwise than as follows:</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262l2" n="232"/>It is as impossible, as needless, to set down
               the innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd through that great thorow-fare of the
               Brain, the Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the whole History of my Life in
               Miniature, or by Abridgment, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262l4">as I may call it,</hi> to
               my coming to this Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came to this
               Island. In my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since I came on Shore on this
                  Island, I was comparing the happy Posture of my Affairs,
               in the first Years of my Habitation here, compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear and
               Care, which I had liv'd ever since I had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand; not
               that I did not believe the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while, and
               might have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there; but I had never
               known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions about it; my Satisfaction was
               perfect, though my Danger was the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger,
               as if I had never really been expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many
               very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely Good that
               Providence is, which has provided in its Government of Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things, and though
               he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers, the Sight
               of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind, and sink his Spirits; he is
               kept serene, and calm, by having the Events of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing
               nothing the Dangers which surround him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264">After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I
               came to reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in, for so many Years, in
               this very Island; and how I had walk'd about in the greatest Security, and with all
               possible Tranquillity; <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l2" n="233" facs="tcp:0653600100:239"/> even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the casual
               Approach of Night, had been between me and the worst kind of Destruction,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l4">viz.</hi> That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals, and Savages, who would
               have seiz'd on me with the same View, as I did of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have
               thought it no more a Crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon, or a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l6" target="curlieu_" corresp="curlieu">Curlieu</ref>

                  bird with a long, curved bill.</note>: I would unjustly slander my self, if I
               should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
               Protection I acknowledg'd, with great Humility, that all
               these unknown Deliverances were due; and without which, I must inevitably have fallen
               into their merciless Hands.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1266">When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken up in considering the
               Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean, the Savages; and how it came to pass in
               the World, that the wise Governour of all Things should give up any of his Creatures
               to such Inhumanity; nay, to something so much below, even
               Brutality it self, as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some (at that Time
               fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to me to enquire, what Part of the World these
               Wretches liv'd in; how far off the Coast was from whence they came; what they
               ventur'd over so far from home for; what kind of Boats they had; and why I might not
               order my self, and my Business so, that I might be as able
               to go over thither, as they were to come to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268">I never so much as troubl'd my self, to consider what I should do with my self, when
               I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the
               Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor
               so much as how it was possible for me to reach the Coast, and <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l2" n="234"/> not be attempted by some or other of them, without any Possibility of delivering my self; and if I should
               not fall into their Hands, what I should do for Provision, or whither I should bend
               my Course; none of these Thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my Mind was
               wholly bent upon the Notion of my passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I look'd
               back upon my present Condition, as the most miserable that
               could possibly be, that I was not able to throw my self into any thing but Death,
               that could be call'd worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
               meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l4">Africk,</hi>
               till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might
               find some Relief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in
               with some Christian Ship, that might take me in; and if the worse came to the worst,
               I could but die, which would put an end to all these Miseries at once. Pray note, all
               this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an impatient Temper,
               made as it were desperate by the long Continuance of my Troubles, and the
               Disappointments I had met in the Wreck, I had been on board of; and where I had been
               so near the obtaining what I so earnestly long'd for, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l6">viz.</hi> Some-body to
               speak to, and to learn some Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the
               probable Means of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts: All
               my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
               the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seem'd to be suspended; and I had, as it
               were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to
               the Main, which came upon me with such Force, and such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not to be resisted.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l2" n="235"/>When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
               Hours, or more, with such Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my
               Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Feaver, meerly with the extraordinary
               Fervour of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
               very Thought of it, threw me into a sound Sleep; one would have thought, I should
               have dream'd of it: But I did not, nor of any Thing relating to it; but I dream'd,
               that as I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle, I saw upon the Shore,
               two <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l4">Canoes,</hi> and eleven Savages coming to Land, and
               that they brought with them another Savage, who they were going to kill, in Order to
               eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage that they were going
               to kill, jumpt away, and ran for his Life; and I thought in my Sleep, that he came
               running into my little thick Grove, before my Fortification, to hide himself; and
               that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the other
               sought him that Way, show'd my self to him, and smiling upon him, encourag'd him;
               that he kneel'd down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I shew'd my
               Ladder, made him go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he became my Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this Man, I said to my self, now I may certainly venture to the main Land; for this Fellow will serve
               me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whether to go for Provisions; and
                  whether not to go for fear of being devoured, what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I wak'd with this
               Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of
               Joy, at the Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which I felt
               upon coming to my self, and finding it was no more than a Dream, were equally
               extravagant the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l6" n="236"/> other Way, and threw me into
               a very great Dejection of Spirit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1272">Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my only Way to go about an Attempt
               for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a Savage into my Possession; and if possible,
               it should be one of their Prisoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, and should
               bring thither to kill; but these Thoughts still were attended with this Difficulty,
               that it was impossible to effect this, without attacking a
               whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate
                  Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other Hand, I had
               greaty scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart trembled at the thoughts of
               shedding so much Blood, tho' it was for my Deliverance. I
               need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd to me against this, they being the same
               mention'd before; but tho' I had other Reasons to offer now (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1272l2">viz.</hi>) that
               those Men were Enemies to my Life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was
               Self-preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver my self from this Death of a
               Life, and was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting
               me, and the like. I say, tho' these Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts of
               shedding Humane Blood for my Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I
               could by no Means reconcile my self to, a great while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1274">However at last, after many secret Disputes with my self, and after great
               Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and another struggl'd in my
               Head a long Time, the eager prevailing Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all
               the rest; and I resolv'd, if possible, to get one of those Savages into my Hands,
               cost what it <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1274l2" n="237"/> would. My next Thing then was to
               contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: But as I could pitch upon no probable Means for
               it, so I resolv'd to put my self upon the Watch, to see them when they came on Shore,
               and leave the rest to the Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should
               present, let be what would be.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276">With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set my self upon the Scout, as often as
               possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily tir'd of
               it, for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for great part of that Time
               went out to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l2">West</hi> End, and to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l4">South West</hi> Corner of the
               Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but none appear'd. This was very
               discouraging, and began to trouble me much, tho' I cannot
               say that it did in this Case, as it had done some time before that, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l6">viz.</hi>)
               wear off the Edge of my Desire to the Thing. But the longer it seem'd to be delay'd,
               the more eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen
               by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1278">Besides, I fancied my self able to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had
               them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,
               and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any
               Hurt. It was a great while, that I pleas'd my self with this Affair, but nothing
               still presented; all my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near
               me for a great while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280">About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and by long musing, had
               as it were resolved them all into nothing, for want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpriz'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280l2" n="238"/> one Morning early, with seeing no less than five
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280l4">Canoes</hi> all on Shore together on my side the Island; and the People who
               belong'd to them all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my
               Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or
               sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
               Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty Men single handed; so I
               lay still in my Castle, perplex'd and discomforted: However I put my self into all
               the same Postures for an Attack that I had formerly
               provided, and was just ready for Action, if any Thing had presented; having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any
               Noise; at length being very impatient, I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
               clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however
               that my Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
               Means; here I observ'd by the help of my Perspective Glass, that they were no less
               than Thirty in Number, that they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dress'd.
               How they had cook'd it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in
               I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way, round the
               Fire.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1282">While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective, two miserable
               Wretches dragg'd from the Boats, where it seems they were laid by, and were now
               brought out for the Slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being
               knock'd down, I suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and two
               or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery, while
               the other Victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1282l2" n="239"/> him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch
                  seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him
               with Hopes of Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness
               along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the Coast, where my
               Habitation was.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1284">I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I
               perceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw him pursued by
               the whole Body, and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming to pass, and that
               he would certainly take shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
               my Dream for the rest of it, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1284l2">viz.</hi>) that the other Savages would not pursue
               him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began to
               recover, when I found that there was not above three Men that follow'd him, and still
               more was I encourag'd, when I found that he outstrip'd them exceedingly in running,
               and gain'd Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an Hour, I saw
               easily he would fairly get away from them all.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1286">There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I mention'd often at the first
               part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly,
               he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there: But when the
               Savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, tho'
               the Tide was then up, but plunging in, swam thro' in about Thirty Strokes or
               thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swiftness; when the Three
               Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two of them could Swim, but the Third cou'd
               not, and that standing on the other Side, he look'd at the other, but went no
               further; and soon after went <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1286l2" n="240"/> softly back
               again, which as it happen'd, was very well for him in the
               main.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288">I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
               Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from them: It came now very warmly upon my
               Thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and
               perhaps a Companion, or Assistant; and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to
               save this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible
               Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders,
               as I observ'd above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the
               Hill, I cross'd toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l2" target="clap_" corresp="clap">clapp'd</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="clap" target="clap_" type="gloss">Placed</note> my self in the way,
               between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd; hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
               back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my
               Hand to him, to come back; and in the mean time, I slowly advanc'd towards the two that follow'd; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
               knock'd him down with the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l5" target="stock_" corresp="stock">Stock</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="stock" target="stock_" type="gloss">The
                  butt of a gun</note> of my Piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have
               the rest hear; though at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and
               being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they wou'd not have easily known what to make of
               it: Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with him stopp'd, as if he
               had been frighted; and I advanc'd a-pace towards him; but as
               I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to
               shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and
               kill'd him at the first Shoot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopp'd; though he
               saw both his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l8" n="241"/> was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece;
               that he stood Stock still, and neither came forward or went backward, tho' he seem'd
               rather enclin'd to fly still, than to come on; I hollow'd again to him, and made
               Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then
               stopp'd again, and then a little further, and stopp'd again, and I cou'd then
               perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner, and had just been
               to be kill'd, as his two Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave
               him all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came nearer and
               nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement for my
               saving his Life: I smil'd at him, and look'd pleasantly, and beckon'd to him to come
               still nearer; at length he came close to me, and then he kneel'd down again, kiss'd
               the Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me
               by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of swearing to be
               my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much of him, and encourag'd him all I
               could. But there was more work to do yet, for I perceived the Savage who I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but stunn'd with
               the blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to him,
               and showing him the Savage, that he was not dead; upon this
               he spoke some Words to me, and though I could not understand
               them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
               Man's Voice, that I had heard, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l10">my own excepted,</hi> for above Twenty Five Years.
               But there was no time for such Reflections now, the Savage
               who was knock'd down recover'd himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I
               perceived that my Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l12" n="242"/> Piece at the
               Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my Savage, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l14">for so I call him now,</hi>
               made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I
               did, he no sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at
               one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l16">Germany,</hi> could
               have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who I had Reason
               to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except
               their own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
               Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so hard, that they will cut off
               Heads even with them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow too; when he had done this,
               he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and with
               abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down with the Head of the
               Savage, that he had kill'd just before me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1290">But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had kill'd the other Indian so
               far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go to him, so I bad him
               go, as well as I could, when he came to him, he stood like one amaz'd, looking at
               him, turn'd him first on one side, then on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet
               had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it had made a Hole, and no
               great Quantity of Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
               dead; He took up his Bow, and Arrows, and came back, so I
               turn'd to go away, and beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to him, that more
               might come after them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292">Upon this he sign'd to me, that he should bury them with Sand, that they might not be
               seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I made Signs again to him to do so; he fell
               to Work, and in an instant he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292l2" n="243"/> had scrap'd a
               Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragg'd
               him into it, and cover'd him, and did so also by the other; I believe he had bury'd
               them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry'd him not to my Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the
               farther Part of the Island; so I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292l4">viz.</hi> That he came into my Grove for shelter.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1294">Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I
               found he was indeed in great Distress for, by his Running; and having refresh'd him,
               I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a
               great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my self
               sometimes; so the poor Creature laid down, and went to sleep.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296">He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made; with straight strong Limbs, not
               too large; tall and well shap'd, and as I reckon, about twenty six Years of Age. He
               had a very good Countenance, not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seem'd to have
               something very manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l2">European</hi> in his Countenance too, especially when he smil'd. His Hair was
               long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his Forehead very high, and large, and a great
               Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite
               black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l4">Brasilians,</hi> and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l6">Virginians,</hi> and other Natives of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l8">America</hi> are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable; tho' not very
               easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump; his Nose small, not flat like the
                  Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l10" n="244"/> fine Teeth well set, and white as Ivory. After
               he had slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he wak'd again, and comes
               out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I had in the Enclosure
               just by: When he espy'd me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the
               Ground, with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful Disposition, making a many
               antick Gestures to show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the Ground, close to
               my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done before; and after this,
               made all the Signs to me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let
               me know, how he would serve me as long as he liv'd; I understood him in many Things,
               and let him know, I was very well pleas'd with him; in a little Time I began to speak
               to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first, I made him know his Name should be
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l12">Friday,</hi> which was the Day I sav'd his Life; I call'd him so for the
               Memory of the Time; I likewise taught him to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l14">Master,</hi> and then let him
               know, that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say, YES, and NO, and to know
               the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him see me
               Drink it before him, and sop my Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do
               the like, which he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very good for
               him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298">I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to
               come with me, and let him know, I would give him some Cloaths, at which he seem'd
               very glad, for he was stark naked: As we went by the Place where he had bury'd the
               two Men, he pointed exactly to the Place, and shew'd me the Marks that he had made to
               find them again, making Signs to me, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298l2" n="245"/> that we
               should dig them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd very angry, express'd my
                  Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
               Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which he did
               immediately, with great Submission. I then led him up to the Top of the Hill, to see
               if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my Glass, I look'd, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but no appearance of them, or of their <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298l4">Canoes</hi>; so that it was
               plain they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, without any search
               after them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300">But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more Courage, and

               at his Back, which I found he could use very dextrously, making him carry one Gun for
               me, and I two for my self, and away we march'd to the Place, where these Creatures
               had been; for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came
               to the Place, my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me, at
               the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at least it was so to
               me; though <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l5">Friday</hi> made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with humane
               Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood, great Pieces of Flesh left here and there,
               half eaten, mangl'd and scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant
               Feast they had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies: I saw three
               Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of
               other Parts of the Bodies; and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l7">Friday,</hi> by his Signs, made me understand,
               that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
               up, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l9" n="246"/> and that he, pointing to himself, was the
               fourth: That there had been a great Battle between them, and their next King, whose
               Subjects it seems he had been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners, all which were carry'd to several Places
               by those that had taken them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
               here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302">I caus'd <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302l2">Friday</hi> to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever

               Fire upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302l4">Friday</hi> had still a
               hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in his Nature;

               Man <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1304l2">Friday</hi>; and first of all, I gave him a pair of Linnen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I mention'd,
               and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little Alteration fitted him very
               well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I
               was now grown a tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a
               Hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was cloath'd for the
               present, tollerably well; and was mighty well pleas'd to see himself almost as well
               cloath'd as his Master: It is true, he went awkardly in these Things at first;
               wearing the Drawers was very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Wast-coat gall'd
               his Shoulders, and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he
               complain'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1304l4" n="247"/> they hurt him, and using himself

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306">The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began to consider where I
               should lodge him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy my
               self; I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
               in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was a Door,
               or Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door Case, and a Door to it of
               Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing the
               Door to open on the inside, I barr'd it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so
               that <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306l2">Friday</hi> could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall,
               without making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my
               first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, covering all my Tent, and
               leaning up to the side of the Hill, which was again laid cross with smaller Sticks
                  instead of <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306l4" target="laths_" corresp="laths">Laths</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="laths" target="laths_" type="gloss">Thin, narrow strips of wood used to form a groundwork upon which to
                  fasten the slates of a roof</note>, and then thatch'd over a great Thickness, with
               the Rice Straw, which was strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left
               to go in or out by the Ladder, I had plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
                  attempted on the outside, would not have open'd at all,
               but would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, I took them
               all in to my Side every Night.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308">But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had
               a more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308l2">Friday</hi> was to me; without Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly
               oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections were ty'd to me,
               like those of a Child to a Father; and I dare say, he would have sacrific'd his Life
               for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308l4" n="248"/> he gave me of
               this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1310">This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that however it
               had pleas'd God, in his Providence, and in the Government of the Works of his Hands,
               to take from so great a Part of the World of his Creatures, the best uses to which
               their Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow'd
               upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same Affections, the same Sentiments
               of Kindness and Obligation, the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs; the same
               Sense of Gratitude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and
               receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer to them
               Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the
               right Uses for which they were bestow'd, than we are; and this made me very
               melancholly sometimes, in reflecting as the several Occasions presented, how mean a
               Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of
               God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and why it has
               pleas'd God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many
               Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage, would make a much better
               use of it than we did.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312">From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312l2">Providence,</hi> and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
               Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and reveal it to
               others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut it up, and check'd my
               Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st.) That we <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312l4" n="249"/>
               did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd; but that as God was
               necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy and Just, so it could
               not be; but that if these Creatures were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that Light which,
               as the Scripture says, was a Law to themselves, and by such
               Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge to be just, tho' the Foundation was not
               discover'd to us: And (2d.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the
               Potter, no Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou form'd me thus?</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1314">But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
                  Business to teach him every Thing, that was proper to
               make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make
               him speak, and understand me when I spake, and he was the aptest Schollar that ever
               was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased, when he
               cou'd but understand me, or make me understand him, that it
               was very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to be so easy, that I
               began to say to my self, that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared
               not, if I was never to remove from the place while I lived.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316">After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought that, in order to
               bring <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l2">Friday</hi> off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the Relish of a
               Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other Flesh; so I took him out with me
               one Morning to the Woods: I went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock,
               and bring him home and dress it. But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying down in
               the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her, I catch'd hold of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l4">Friday,</hi> hold says I, stand still; and made Signs to him
                  <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l6" n="250"/> not to stir, immediately I presented my
               Piece, shot and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature who had at a Distance
               indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how it
               was done, was sensibly surpriz'd, trembled, and shook, and
               look'd so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He
               did not see the Kid I shot at, or perceive I had kill'd it, but ripp'd up his
               Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently thought I was
               resolv'd to kill him; for he came and kneel'd down to me, and embraceing my Knees,
               said a great many Things I did not understand; but I could
               easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318">I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and taking him up by
               the Hand laugh'd at him, and pointed to the Kid which I had kill'd, beckoned to him
               to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how
               the Creature was kill'd, I loaded my Gun again, and by and
               by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318l2">Friday</hi> understand a little what I would do, I call'd him to me again,
               pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a Hawk, I
               say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let
               him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that
               Bird; according I fir'd and bad him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall, he
               stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had
               said to him; and I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see me put any
               Thing into the Gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and
               Destruction in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beast, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318l4" n="251"/> Bird, or any Thing near, or far off; and the Astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear off
               for a long Time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp'd me
               and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would not so much as touch it for several Days
               after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learn'd of him, was to
               desire it not to kill him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1320">Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and
               fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stay'd some Time; for the Parrot not
               being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good way off from the Place where she fell;
               however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceiv'd his
               Ignorance about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
               charge the Gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
               other Mark that might present; but nothing more offer'd at that Time; so I brought
               home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I
               could; and having a Pot for that purpose, I boil'd, or stew'd some of the Flesh, and
               made some very good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my Man,
               who seem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
               which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made a Sign to me,
               that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own Mouth, he seem'd
               to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water
               after it; on the other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I
               pretended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at the Salt;
               but it would not do, he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1320l2" n="252"/> would never care for
               Salt with his Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very
               little.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322">Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth, I was resolv'd to feast him the next
               Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did by hanging it before the Fire, in a
               String, as I had seen many People do in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322l2">England,</hi> setting two Poles up, one
               on each side the Fire, and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the
               Cross-stick, letting the Meat turn continually: This <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322l4">Friday</hi> admir'd very much; but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so
               many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that I could not but understand him; and
               at last he told me he would never eat Man's Flesh any more, which I was very glad to
               hear.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1324">The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out, and sifting it in the manner
               I us'd to do, as I observ'd before, and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
               especially after he had seen what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to make
               Bread of; for after that I let him see me make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a
               little Time <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1324l2">Friday</hi> was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I could do
               it my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326">I begun now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead of one, I must
               provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity of Corn, than I us'd
               to do; so I mark'd out a larger Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner
               as before, in which <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326l2">Friday</hi> not only work'd very willingly, and very hard;
               but did it very chearfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for Corn to
               make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him,
               and my self too: He appear'd very sensible of that Part, and let me know, that he
               thought I had <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326l4" n="253"/> much more Labour upon me on his
               Account, than I had for my self; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would
               tell him what to do.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328">This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328l2">Friday</hi>
               began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost every Thing I had
               occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to send him to, and talk'd a great
               deal to me; so that in short I began now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which
               indeed I had very little occasion for before; that is to say, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328l4">about Speech</hi>;
               besides the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd Honesty,
               appear'd to me more and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and
               on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it was possible for him ever to love any
               Thing before.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1330">I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his own Country
               again, and having learn'd him <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1330l2">English</hi> so well that he could answer me almost
               any Questions, I ask'd him whether the Nation that he
               belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle, at which he smil'd; and said; yes, yes, we
               always fight the better; that is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we
               began the following Discourse: You always fight the better said I, How came you to be
               taken Prisoner then, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1330l4">Friday?</hi>

                  being the same I formerly mention'd, he presently knew
               the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and
               one Child; he could not tell Twenty in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1358l4">English</hi>; but he numbred them by
               laying so many Stones on a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360">I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that after I had had
               this Discourse with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our Island to the Shore, and whether the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360l2">Canoes</hi> were not often lost; he told
               me, there was no Danger, no <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360l4">Canoes</hi> ever lost; but that after a little way
               out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always one way in the Morning, the
               other in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l2" n="255"/>This I understood to be no more than the Sets
               of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was
               occasion'd by the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l4">Oroonooko</hi>; in the Mouth, or the Gulph of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island lay; and this Land
               which I perceiv'd to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l6">W.</hi> and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l8">N. W.</hi> was the great Island
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l10">Trinidad,</hi> on the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l12">North</hi> Point of the Mouth of the River: I ask'd
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l14">Friday</hi> a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the Sea,
               the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest
               Openness imaginable; I ask'd him the Names of the several
               Nations of his Sort of People; but could get no other Name
               than <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l16">Caribs</hi>; from whence I easily understood, that
               these were the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l18">Caribbees,</hi> which our Maps place on the Part of
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l20">America,</hi> which reaches from the Mouth of the River <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l22">Oroonooko</hi> to

               way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l28">W.</hi> from their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men, like me; and
               pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd before; and that they had kill'd
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l30">much Mans,</hi> that was his Word; by all which I understood, he meant the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l32">Spaniards,</hi> whose Cruelties in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l34">America</hi> had been spread over the
               whole Countries, and was remember'd by all the Nations from Father to Son.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364">I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island, and get among those
               white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364l2">in two Canoe</hi>; I could not
               understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364l4">two
                  Canoe,</hi> till at last with great Difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a

               to relish with me very well, and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one
               Time or other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place; and
               that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368">During the long Time that <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l2">Friday</hi> has now been with me, and that he began to
               speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly I ask'd him one Time who made him? The poor
               Creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had ask'd who was his Father;
               but I took it by another handle, and ask'd him who made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd
               on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it was one old <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l4">Benamuckee,</hi> that liv'd beyond all: He could describe nothing of this great
               Person, but that he was very old; much older he said than the Sea, or the Land; than
               the Moon, or the Stars: I ask'd him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why
               did not all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect Look of
               Innocence, said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l6">All Things do say O to him:</hi> I ask'd him if the People who
               die in his Country went away any where; he said, yes, they all went to <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l8" target="benamuckee_" corresp="benamuckee">Benamuckee</ref>

               I ask'd him whether these they eat up went thither too, he said yes.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370">From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of the true God: I told
               him that the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there, pointing up towards Heaven:
               That he governs the World by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it:
               That he was omnipotent, could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to us, take
               every Thing from us; and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes.
               He listned with great Attention, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l2" n="257"/> and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l4">Jesus
                  Christ</hi> being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making our Prayers to
               God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven; he told me one Day, that if our
               God could hear us up beyond the Sun, he must needs be a
               greater God than their <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l6">Benamuckee,</hi> who liv'd but a little way off, and yet
               could not hear, till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to
               him; I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never
               went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who he call'd their <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l8" target="oowocakee_" corresp="oowocakee">Oowocakee,</ref>

               explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l11">O,</hi>
               (so he called saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l13">Benamuckee</hi> said: By this I observ'd, That there is <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l15">Priestcraft,</hi>
               even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World;
               and the Policy of making a secret Religion, in order to
               preserve the Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not
               only to be found in the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l17">Roman,</hi> but perhaps among
               all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372">I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l2">Friday,</hi> and told him, that
               the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains, to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l4">O</hi> to their God
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l6">Benamuckee,</hi> was a Cheat, and their bringing Word from thence what he
               said, was much more so; that if they met with any Answer, or spake with any one
               there, it must be with an evil Spirit: And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil, the Original of him, his
               Rebellion against God, his Enmity to Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in
               the dark Parts of the World to be Worship'd instead of God,
               and as God; and the many Stratagems <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l8" n="258"/> he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruine; how he
               had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to adapt his Snares so to
               our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own Tempters, and to run upon our
               Destruction by our own Choice.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1374">I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his
               Mind about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my
                  Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity of a
               great first Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence, and
               of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us, and the like. But
               there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his
               Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor Creature puzzl'd
               me once in such a manner, by a Question meerly natural and innocent, that I scarce
               knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature to Sin, his
               being a consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity, how, as he had made us all, he
               could destroy us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great
               Seriousness to me all the while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376">After this, I had been telling him how the Devil was God's
               Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
               Designs of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World; and the like.
               Well, says <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l2">Friday,</hi> but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much
               strong, much might as the Devil? Yes, yes, says I, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l4">Friday,</hi> God is stronger
               than the Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
               down under our Feet, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l6" n="259"/> and enable us to resist
               his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l8">But,</hi> says he again, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l10">if God
                  much strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no
                  more do wicked?</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378">I was strangely surpriz'd at his Question, and after all, tho' I was now an old Man,
               yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough quallified for a Casuist, or a Solver of
               Difficulties: And at first I could not tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear
               him, and ask'd him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his
                  Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken
               Words, as above. By this time I had recovered my self a little, and I said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l2">God
                  will at last punish him severely</hi>; he is <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l4">reserv'd for the Judgment, and is
                  to be cast into the Bottomless-Pit, to dwell with everlasting Fire.</hi> This did not satisfie <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l6">Friday,</hi> but he returns upon
               me, repeating my Words, RESERVE, AT LAST, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l8">me no underderstand; but, Why not kill
                  the Devil now, not kill great ago?</hi> You may as well ask me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l10">said I,</hi>
               Why God does not kill you and I, when we do wicked Things here that offend him? We
               are preserv'd to repent and be pardon'd: He muses a while at this; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l12">well,
                  well,</hi> says he, mighty affectionately, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l14">that well; so you, I, Devil, all
                     wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.</hi>
               Here I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testimony to me,
               how the meer Notions of Nature, though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the
               Consequence of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can from the Knowledge
               of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l16">Jesus Christ,</hi> and of a Redemption purchas'd for
               us, of a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-stool of
               God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form these in <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l18" n="260"/> the Soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our
               Lord and Saviour <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l20">Jesus Christ</hi>; I mean, the Word of God, and the Spirit of
               God promis'd for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People, are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the saving
               Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380">I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my
               Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending him
               for something a good way off, I seriously pray'd to God that he would enable me to
               instruct savingly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit
               the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the Light of the Knowledge of God
               in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l2">Christ,</hi> reconciling him to himself, and would
               guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God, as his Conscience might be
               convinc'd, his Eyes open'd, and his Soul sav'd. When he came again to me, I entred
               into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the
               Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd from Heaven,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l4">viz.</hi> of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Blessed Lord
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l6">Jesus.</hi> I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our Blessed
               Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l8">Abraham,</hi> and
               how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption; that he came
               only to the lost Sheep of the House of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l10">Israel,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382">I had, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l2">God knows,</hi> more Sincerity than Knowledge, in
               all the Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must acknowledge
               what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find, That in laying Things
               open to him, I really inform'd and instructed my self in many Things, that either I
               did not know, or had not fully consider'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l4" n="261"/>
               before; but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind, upon my searching into them, for the
               Information of this poor Savage; and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things
               upon this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild Wretch
               was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be thankful that ever he came to
               me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond
               Measure; and when I reflected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd
               to, I had not only been moved my self to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand
               that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to
               save the Life, and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l6">for ought I knew,</hi> the Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of Religion, and
               of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l8">to know whom is Life
                     eternal.</hi> I say, when I reflected upon all these
               Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I frequently rejoyc'd
               that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful
               of all Afflictions that could possibly have befallen me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384">In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my
               Time, and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l2">Friday</hi> and I,
               was such, as made the three Years which we liv'd there together perfectly and
               compleatly happy, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l4">if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form'd in a
                     sublunary State.</hi> The Savage was now a good
                  Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to
               hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd
               Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to
               instruct, than if we had been in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l6">England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l2" n="262"/>I always apply'd my self in Reading the
                  Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
               Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious
               Enquiries, and Questionings, made me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l4">as I said before,</hi> a much better
               Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have been by my own private
               meer Reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing
               here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part of my Life,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l6">viz.</hi> How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing
               it is, that the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l8">Christ Jesus,</hi> is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy
               to be receiv'd and understood: That as the bare reading the
               Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly on
               to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in Practice,
               and Obedience to all God's Commands, and this without any Teacher or Instructer; I mean, humane; so the same plain
               Instruction sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this
               Savage Creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal
               to him in my Life.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388">As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife and Contention, which has happen'd in the
               World about Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government,
               they were all perfectly useless to us; as for ought I can
               yet see, they have been to all the rest of the World: We had the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l2">sure Guide</hi>
               to Heaven, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l4">viz.</hi> The Word of God; and we had, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l6">blessed be God,</hi>
               comfortable Views of the Spirit of God teaching and
               instructing us by his Word, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l8">leading us into all Truth,</hi> and making us both
                  willing and obedient to the Instruction of his Word; and
               I cannot see the least Use that the greatest <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l10" n="263"/>
               Knowledge of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions in the
               World would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd it;
               but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things, and take every Part in its
               order.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390">After <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l2">Friday</hi> and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
               fluently, though in broken <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l4">English</hi> to me; I acquainted him with my own Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into
               the Place, how I had liv'd there, and how long. I let him into the Mystery, for such
               it was to him, of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to shoot: I gave him a
               Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made
               him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, such as in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l6">England</hi> we wear <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l8" target="hanger_" corresp="hanger">Hangers</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="hanger" target="hanger_" type="gloss">Swords</note> in; and in the Frog, instead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet,
               which was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392">I describ'd to him the Country of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392l2">Europe,</hi> and particularly <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392l4">England,</hi>
               which I came from; how we liv'd, how we worshipp'd God, how we behav'd to one
               another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World: I gave him an Account
               of the Wreck which I had been on board of, and shew'd him as near as I could, the
               Place where she lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394">I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd, and which I could
               not stir with my whole Strength then; but was now fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon
               seeing this Boat, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394l2">Friday</hi> stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I
               ask'd him what it was he study'd upon, at last says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394l4">me see such Boat like
                  come to Place at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396">I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examin'd farther into
               it, I understood <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396l2" n="264"/> by
               him, that a Boat, such as that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he
               liv'd; that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I
               presently imagin'd, that some <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396l4">European</hi> Ship must have been cast away upon
               their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive a Shore; but was so dull, that I
               never once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither, much less whence they
               might come; so I only enquir'd after a Description of the
               Boat.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398">
               <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l2">Friday</hi> describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me better to
               understand him, when he added with some Warmth, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l4">we save
                  the white Mans from drown:</hi> Then I presently ask'd him, if there was any <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l6">white Mans,</hi> as he call'd them, in the Boat;
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l8">yes,</hi> he said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l10">the Boat full white Mans:</hi> I ask'd him how many; he
               told upon his Fingers seventeen: I ask'd him then what become of them; he told me,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l12">they live, they dwell at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1400">This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd, that these might be the
               Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away in Sight of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1400l2">my Island,</hi> as I
               now call it; and who after the Ship was struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had sav'd themselves in their Boat, and were
               landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402">Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically, What was become of them? He assur'd me
               they lived still there; that they had been there about four
               Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them Victuals to live. I ask'd him,
               How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them? He said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l2">No, they make
                  Brother with them</hi>; that is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l4">They no eat Mans but when make the War fight</hi>; that is to <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l6" n="265"/> say, they never eat any Men but such as come to fight
               with them, and are taken in Battle.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404">It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of the Hill, at the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l2">East</hi> Side of the Island, from whence as I have said, I had in a clear Day
               discover'd the Main, or Continent of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l4">America; Friday,</hi> the Weather being very
               serene, looks very earnestly towards the Main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls
               a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance from him: I
               ask'd him, What was the Matter? <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l6">O joy!</hi> Says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l8">O glad! There see my
                  Country, there my Nation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406">I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in
               his Face, and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness,
               as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and this Observation of mine, put
               a great many Thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new Man
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406l2">Friday</hi> as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406l4">Friday</hi>
               could get back to his own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion,
               but all his Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Countrymen an
               Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or two
               of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he us'd to be
               with those of his Enemies, when they were taken in War.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1408">But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very much, for which I was very sorry
               afterwards. However as my Jealousy encreased, and held me some Weeks, I was a little
               more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
               certainly in the Wrong too, the honest grateful Creature
               having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best Principles, both <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1408l2" n="266"/> as a religious Christian, and as a grateful
               Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1410">While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every Day pumping him to see
               if he would discover any of the new Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found every thing he said was so Honest, and so Innocent,
               that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and in spight of all my Uneasiness
               he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the
               least perceive that I was Uneasie, and therefore I could not
               suspect him of Deceit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412">One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being haizy at Sea, so that we
               could not see the Continent, I call'd to him, and said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l2">Friday,</hi> do not you wish your self in your own Country, your own Nation? Yes, he said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l4">he be much O glad to
                  be at his own Nation.</hi> What would you do there said I, would you turn Wild
               again, eat Mens Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before. He lookt full of
               Concern, and shaking his Head said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l6">No no,</hi> Friday <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l8">tell them to live
                  Good,</hi> tell them <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l10">to pray God,</hi> tell them <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l12">to eat Corn-bread,
                  Cattle-flesh, Milk, no eat Man again</hi>: Why then said I to him, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l14">They will
                  kill you.</hi> He look'd grave at that, and then said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l16">No, they no kill me,
                  they willing love learn</hi>: He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
               added, they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans that come in the Boat. Then I ask'd him
               if he would go back to them? He smil'd at that, and told me he could not swim so far.
               I told him I would make a <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l18">Canoe</hi> for him. He told me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l20">he would go, if I
                  would go with him.</hi> I go! says I, why they will Eat me if I come there? No,
               no, says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l22">me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you:</hi> He meant
               he would tell them how I had kill'd his Enemies, and sav'd his Life, and so he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l24" n="267"/> would make them love me; then he told me as
               well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White-men, or Bearded-men, as he
               call'd them, who came on Shore there in Distress.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414">From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly
               joyn with these Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l2">Spaniards</hi> or
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l4">Portuguese</hi>; not doubting but if I could we might find some Method to
               Escape from thence, being upon the Continent, and a good Company together; better
               than I could from an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without Help. So after
               some Days I took <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l6">Friday</hi> to work again, by way of Discourse, and told him I
               would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and accordingly I carry'd him to
               my Frigate which lay on the other Side of the Island, and having clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it sunk in the Water; I brought it out,
               shewed it him, and we both went into it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416">I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it, would
               make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said to
               him, Well now, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l2">Friday,</hi> shall we go to your Nation?
               He look'd very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he thought the Boat
               too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next Day I went to the
               Place where the first Boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into
               Water: He said that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
               lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun had split and dry'd it, that it was
               in a manner rotten. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l4">Friday</hi> told me such a Boat would do very well, and would
               carry <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l6">much enough Vittle, Drink, Bread,</hi> that was his Way of Talking.</p>

               them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I
               had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest run wild in the Woods, and became indeed
               troublesom to me at last; for they would often come into my House, and plunder me
               too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length
               they left me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful
               Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
               but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like
               to have too much.</p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l2" n="176"/>I was something impatient, as I have observ'd,
               to have the Use of my Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore
               sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I sat
               my self down contented enough without her. But I had a
               strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have
               said, in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the
               Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd upon me
               every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge of the Shore, I did so: But had any one in

               them, or rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
               my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1004l6">Yorkshire</hi> with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd to take

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012">But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe me, that it
               was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part. In this kind of
               Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along
               the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1012l2" n="178"/> Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I
               first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now
               to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the
               same Height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks
               which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I
               was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Current,
               any more there than in other Places.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014">I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some Time in the
               observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l2">viz.</hi> That the Tide of Ebb setting from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l4">West,</hi> and joyning
               with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion
               of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l6">West,</hi> or from the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l8">North,</hi> this Current came nearer, or went
               farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock
               again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther of, being near half a League
               from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd me and
               my <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1014l10">Canoe</hi> along with it, which at another Time it would not have done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016">This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but
               to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my
               Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of
               putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
               Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience; but on
               the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l2" n="179"/> though more laborious; and this was, That I would
               build, or rather make me another <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l4">Periagau</hi> or <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1016l6">Canoe</hi>; and so have one
               for one Side of the Island, and one for the other.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1018">You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations in the
               Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about it under the Rock,
               with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments,
               or Caves, one within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest, and
               had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say, beyond where my Wall
               joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have
               given an Account, and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five
               or six Bushels each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some
               in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with my Hand.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020">As for my Wall made, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1020l2">as before,</hi> with long Stakes or Piles, those Piles grew
               all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
               there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind
               them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1022">Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and upon lower
               Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd, and
               which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for
               more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024">Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation there
               also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair;
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l2">that is to say,</hi> I kept the Hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted
               up to its usual Height, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l4" n="180"/> the Ladder standing
               always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes,
               but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might
               spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did
               effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for
               that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
               made me a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1024l6" target="squab_" corresp="squab">Squab</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="squab" target="squab_" type="gloss">A

               the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd, and with other soft
               Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had
               saved, and a great Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
               absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1026">Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say, my Goats: And as
               I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
               lest the Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour I
               had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near to one
               another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a
               Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in
               the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed stronger than
               any Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028">This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains to bring to
               pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame
               Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
               Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1028l2" n="181"/> for me as
               long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in
               my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures
               to such a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by this Method
                  indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick,
               I was forced to pull some of them up again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1030">In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my
               Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet; and
               indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032">As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation,
               and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in my Way
               thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all Things about or
               belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out in her to divert my self,
               but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1032l2" target="stonecast_" corresp="stonecast">Stone's Cast</ref>

               Shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out of my
               Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034">It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd
               with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in
               the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition; I
               listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any Thing, I went up to a
               rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all
               one, I could see no other <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1034l2" n="182"/> Impression but that
               one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not
               be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for there was exactly the very Print of
               a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor
               could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man
               perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling,
               as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me
               at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it
               possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
               Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
               in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the
               Way.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1036">When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this, I fled into it
               like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a
               Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never
               frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to this
               Retreat.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038">I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright, the
               greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary
               to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
               Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful
               Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it
               must be the Devil; and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this
                  Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l2" n="183"/> Shape come into
               the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there of any other
               Footsteps? And how was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1038l4">Satan</hi> should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could
               be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and
               that even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an
               Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
               of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot. That as I
               liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island, he would never have been so simple to
               leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the Sand too, which the first Surge of the
               Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with
               the Thing it self, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of
               the Devil.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040">Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out
               of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it
               must be some more dangerous Creature, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l2">viz.</hi>) That it must be some of the
               Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in their
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l4">Canoes</hi>; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds had <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1040l6" target="arrived_" corresp="arrived">made</ref>

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1042">While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful in my
               Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they did

               search'd farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their
               having found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should
               certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
               happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my Enclosure, destroy all
               my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should
                  perish at last for meer Want.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1044">Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence in God which
               was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness, now
               vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
               Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness. I reproach'd my self
               with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me
               till the next Season, as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
               Crop that was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
               for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand,
               so that whatever might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.</p>

               Time in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was, that I
               seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
               Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l5" n="185"/> to what I call'd silent Life; that I was as one who
               Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living,
               or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my own
               Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
               Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation, could
               bestow; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1046l7">I say,</hi> that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing
               a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance
               of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1048">Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many curious
               Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my
               first Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise
               and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could not foresee what
               the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his
               Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern
               and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as
               I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my
               Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd against him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1050">I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had
               thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he
               did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely
               and entirely to his Will; and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him,
               pray to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
               Providence.</p>

               nay, I may say, Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect
               of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I cannot omit, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l4">viz.</hi> One Morning early,
               lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of
               Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which
               those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1052l6" target="psalm50_" corresp="psalm50">Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054">Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted, but I
               was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
               first Words that presented to me, were, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1054l2" target="psalms_" corresp="psalms">Wait

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1056">In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and

               might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me
               up a little too, and I began to perswade my self it was all
               a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and
               why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I
               could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if
               at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part of those Fools,
               who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted at
               them more than any body.</p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1058l2" n="187"/>Now I began to take Courage, and to peep
               abroad again; for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so
               that I began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but
               some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
                  usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures
               were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd
               some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1060">Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of

               again, and went to my Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I
               went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay
               down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was
                  haunted with an evil Conscience, or that I had been
                  lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1062">However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen nothing, I began to
               be a little bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
               it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not perswade my self
               fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a
               Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to

               came to measure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot

               again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in
               short, that the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course to take for my Security I
               knew not.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1064">O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear! It deprives them of
               the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief. The first Thing I
               propos'd to my self, was, to throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle
               wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island
               in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the
               simple Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find such a Grain
               there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any
               Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
               Persons inhabiting.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1066">These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation,
               after I was come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind
               were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as
               above: Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more
               terrifying than Danger it self, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
               anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that Relief in this
               Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1068">This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning I fell
               asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were, tyr'd, and my

               better compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately; and
               upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so
               exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen,
               was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
               altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet that there might
               sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with Design, or perhaps never,
               but when they were driven by cross Winds, might come to this Place.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1070">That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least Shadow or
               Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should be driven here, it was
               probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
               thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion, to this Time.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072">That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual accidental
               Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely if they were driven
               hither, were here against their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again
               with all possible Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, least they should not
               have the Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and that therefore I had
               nothing to do but to consider <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1072l2" n="190"/> of some safe
               Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the
               Spot.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1074">Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to bring a Door
               through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where
               my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore, I
               resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double
               Row of Trees, about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles
               to be driven between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall
               would be soon finish'd.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1076">So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickned with Pieces of
               Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to
               make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put my Arm
               out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick, with
               continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
               walking upon it; and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of
               which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I
               planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
               that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time:
               This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe
               till it was done.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078">When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great way every
               way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l2" target="osier_" corresp="osier">Osier</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="osier" target="osier_" type="gloss">A variety of Eurasian willows</note> like Wood, which I found so apt
               to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1078l5" n="191"/> twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty
               large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an Enemy, and
               they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted to approach my
               outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1080">Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood
               before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed
               perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a
               Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left
               no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which was low,
               and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that; so when the two
               Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to me without mischieving
                  himself; and if they had come down, they were still on
               the Out-side of my outer Wall.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1082">Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation;
               and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether without just Reason;
               though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1084">While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my
               other Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they
               were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion,
               and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also
               without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the
               Advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086">To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two Ways to preserve
               them; <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1086l2" n="192"/> one was to find another convenient
               Place to dig a a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the
               other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another and as
               much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each
               Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
               raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this,
               tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I
               thought was the most rational Design.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1088">Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of the Island; and I
               pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart
               could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and
               thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once before, endeavouring to come back that Way from the Eastern
               Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so
                  surrounded with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by
               Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour to make
               it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1090">I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than a Month's
               Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which you please, who
               were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this
               Piece; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it
               as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more
               Time by a great deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l2" n="193"/>All this Labour I was at the Expence of,
               purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had
               seen; for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now
               liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made
               my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who
               know what it is to live in the constant Snare of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l4">the Fear of Man</hi>; and this I
               must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my
               Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part
               of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom
               found my self in a due Temper for <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1092l6" target="supplication_" corresp="supplication">Application to my Maker</ref>

               twentieth Year of my first setting Foot in this Island of
               Solitariness; I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health, had no
               Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any Uneasiness of Mind, more than
               ordinary; but could by no means close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a
               Wink all Night long, otherwise than as follows:</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262l2" n="232"/>It is as impossible, as needless, to set down
               the innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd through that great thorow-fare of the
               Brain, the Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the whole History of my Life in
               Miniature, or by Abridgment, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1262l4">as I may call it,</hi> to
               my coming to this Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came to this
               Island. In my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since I came on Shore on this
                  Island, I was comparing the happy Posture of my Affairs,
               in the first Years of my Habitation here, compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear and
               Care, which I had liv'd ever since I had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand; not
               that I did not believe the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while, and
               might have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there; but I had never
               known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions about it; my Satisfaction was
               perfect, though my Danger was the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger,
               as if I had never really been expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many
               very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely Good that
               Providence is, which has provided in its Government of Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things, and though
               he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers, the Sight
               of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind, and sink his Spirits; he is
               kept serene, and calm, by having the Events of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing
               nothing the Dangers which surround him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264">After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I
               came to reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in, for so many Years, in
               this very Island; and how I had walk'd about in the greatest Security, and with all
               possible Tranquillity; <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l2" n="233" facs="tcp:0653600100:239"/> even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the casual
               Approach of Night, had been between me and the worst kind of Destruction,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l4">viz.</hi> That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals, and Savages, who would
               have seiz'd on me with the same View, as I did of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have
               thought it no more a Crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon, or a <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1264l6" target="curlieu_" corresp="curlieu">Curlieu</ref>

                  bird with a long, curved bill.</note>: I would unjustly slander my self, if I
               should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
               Protection I acknowledg'd, with great Humility, that all
               these unknown Deliverances were due; and without which, I must inevitably have fallen
               into their merciless Hands.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1266">When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken up in considering the
               Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean, the Savages; and how it came to pass in
               the World, that the wise Governour of all Things should give up any of his Creatures
               to such Inhumanity; nay, to something so much below, even
               Brutality it self, as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some (at that Time
               fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to me to enquire, what Part of the World these
               Wretches liv'd in; how far off the Coast was from whence they came; what they
               ventur'd over so far from home for; what kind of Boats they had; and why I might not
               order my self, and my Business so, that I might be as able
               to go over thither, as they were to come to me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268">I never so much as troubl'd my self, to consider what I should do with my self, when
               I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the
               Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor
               so much as how it was possible for me to reach the Coast, and <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l2" n="234"/> not be attempted by some or other of them, without any Possibility of delivering my self; and if I should
               not fall into their Hands, what I should do for Provision, or whither I should bend
               my Course; none of these Thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my Mind was
               wholly bent upon the Notion of my passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I look'd
               back upon my present Condition, as the most miserable that
               could possibly be, that I was not able to throw my self into any thing but Death,
               that could be call'd worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
               meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l4">Africk,</hi>
               till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might
               find some Relief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in
               with some Christian Ship, that might take me in; and if the worse came to the worst,
               I could but die, which would put an end to all these Miseries at once. Pray note, all
               this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an impatient Temper,
               made as it were desperate by the long Continuance of my Troubles, and the
               Disappointments I had met in the Wreck, I had been on board of; and where I had been
               so near the obtaining what I so earnestly long'd for, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1268l6">viz.</hi> Some-body to
               speak to, and to learn some Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the
               probable Means of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts: All
               my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
               the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seem'd to be suspended; and I had, as it
               were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to
               the Main, which came upon me with such Force, and such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not to be resisted.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270">
               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l2" n="235"/>When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
               Hours, or more, with such Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my
               Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Feaver, meerly with the extraordinary
               Fervour of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
               very Thought of it, threw me into a sound Sleep; one would have thought, I should
               have dream'd of it: But I did not, nor of any Thing relating to it; but I dream'd,
               that as I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle, I saw upon the Shore,
               two <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l4">Canoes,</hi> and eleven Savages coming to Land, and
               that they brought with them another Savage, who they were going to kill, in Order to
               eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage that they were going
               to kill, jumpt away, and ran for his Life; and I thought in my Sleep, that he came
               running into my little thick Grove, before my Fortification, to hide himself; and
               that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the other
               sought him that Way, show'd my self to him, and smiling upon him, encourag'd him;
               that he kneel'd down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I shew'd my
               Ladder, made him go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he became my Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this Man, I said to my self, now I may certainly venture to the main Land; for this Fellow will serve
               me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whether to go for Provisions; and
                  whether not to go for fear of being devoured, what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I wak'd with this
               Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of
               Joy, at the Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which I felt
               upon coming to my self, and finding it was no more than a Dream, were equally
               extravagant the <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1270l6" n="236"/> other Way, and threw me into
               a very great Dejection of Spirit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1272">Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my only Way to go about an Attempt
               for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a Savage into my Possession; and if possible,
               it should be one of their Prisoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, and should
               bring thither to kill; but these Thoughts still were attended with this Difficulty,
               that it was impossible to effect this, without attacking a
               whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate
                  Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other Hand, I had
               greaty scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart trembled at the thoughts of
               shedding so much Blood, tho' it was for my Deliverance. I
               need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd to me against this, they being the same
               mention'd before; but tho' I had other Reasons to offer now (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1272l2">viz.</hi>) that
               those Men were Enemies to my Life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was
               Self-preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver my self from this Death of a
               Life, and was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting
               me, and the like. I say, tho' these Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts of
               shedding Humane Blood for my Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I
               could by no Means reconcile my self to, a great while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1274">However at last, after many secret Disputes with my self, and after great
               Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and another struggl'd in my
               Head a long Time, the eager prevailing Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all
               the rest; and I resolv'd, if possible, to get one of those Savages into my Hands,
               cost what it <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1274l2" n="237"/> would. My next Thing then was to
               contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: But as I could pitch upon no probable Means for
               it, so I resolv'd to put my self upon the Watch, to see them when they came on Shore,
               and leave the rest to the Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should
               present, let be what would be.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276">With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set my self upon the Scout, as often as
               possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily tir'd of
               it, for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for great part of that Time
               went out to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l2">West</hi> End, and to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l4">South West</hi> Corner of the
               Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but none appear'd. This was very
               discouraging, and began to trouble me much, tho' I cannot
               say that it did in this Case, as it had done some time before that, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1276l6">viz.</hi>)
               wear off the Edge of my Desire to the Thing. But the longer it seem'd to be delay'd,
               the more eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen
               by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1278">Besides, I fancied my self able to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had
               them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,
               and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any
               Hurt. It was a great while, that I pleas'd my self with this Affair, but nothing
               still presented; all my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near
               me for a great while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280">About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and by long musing, had
               as it were resolved them all into nothing, for want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpriz'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280l2" n="238"/> one Morning early, with seeing no less than five
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1280l4">Canoes</hi> all on Shore together on my side the Island; and the People who
               belong'd to them all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my
               Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or
               sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
               Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty Men single handed; so I
               lay still in my Castle, perplex'd and discomforted: However I put my self into all
               the same Postures for an Attack that I had formerly
               provided, and was just ready for Action, if any Thing had presented; having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any
               Noise; at length being very impatient, I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
               clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however
               that my Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
               Means; here I observ'd by the help of my Perspective Glass, that they were no less
               than Thirty in Number, that they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dress'd.
               How they had cook'd it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in
               I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way, round the
               Fire.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1282">While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective, two miserable
               Wretches dragg'd from the Boats, where it seems they were laid by, and were now
               brought out for the Slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being
               knock'd down, I suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and two
               or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery, while
               the other Victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1282l2" n="239"/> him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch
                  seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him
               with Hopes of Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness
               along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the Coast, where my
               Habitation was.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1284">I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I
               perceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw him pursued by
               the whole Body, and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming to pass, and that
               he would certainly take shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
               my Dream for the rest of it, (<hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1284l2">viz.</hi>) that the other Savages would not pursue
               him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began to
               recover, when I found that there was not above three Men that follow'd him, and still
               more was I encourag'd, when I found that he outstrip'd them exceedingly in running,
               and gain'd Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an Hour, I saw
               easily he would fairly get away from them all.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1286">There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I mention'd often at the first
               part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly,
               he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there: But when the
               Savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, tho'
               the Tide was then up, but plunging in, swam thro' in about Thirty Strokes or
               thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swiftness; when the Three
               Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two of them could Swim, but the Third cou'd
               not, and that standing on the other Side, he look'd at the other, but went no
               further; and soon after went <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1286l2" n="240"/> softly back
               again, which as it happen'd, was very well for him in the
               main.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288">I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
               Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from them: It came now very warmly upon my
               Thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and
               perhaps a Companion, or Assistant; and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to
               save this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible
               Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders,
               as I observ'd above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the
               Hill, I cross'd toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill, <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l2" target="clap_" corresp="clap">clapp'd</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="clap" target="clap_" type="gloss">Placed</note> my self in the way,
               between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd; hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
               back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my
               Hand to him, to come back; and in the mean time, I slowly advanc'd towards the two that follow'd; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
               knock'd him down with the <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l5" target="stock_" corresp="stock">Stock</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="stock" target="stock_" type="gloss">The
                  butt of a gun</note> of my Piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have
               the rest hear; though at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and
               being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they wou'd not have easily known what to make of
               it: Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with him stopp'd, as if he
               had been frighted; and I advanc'd a-pace towards him; but as
               I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to
               shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and
               kill'd him at the first Shoot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopp'd; though he
               saw both his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l8" n="241"/> was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece;
               that he stood Stock still, and neither came forward or went backward, tho' he seem'd
               rather enclin'd to fly still, than to come on; I hollow'd again to him, and made
               Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then
               stopp'd again, and then a little further, and stopp'd again, and I cou'd then
               perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner, and had just been
               to be kill'd, as his two Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave
               him all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came nearer and
               nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement for my
               saving his Life: I smil'd at him, and look'd pleasantly, and beckon'd to him to come
               still nearer; at length he came close to me, and then he kneel'd down again, kiss'd
               the Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me
               by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of swearing to be
               my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much of him, and encourag'd him all I
               could. But there was more work to do yet, for I perceived the Savage who I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but stunn'd with
               the blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to him,
               and showing him the Savage, that he was not dead; upon this
               he spoke some Words to me, and though I could not understand
               them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
               Man's Voice, that I had heard, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l10">my own excepted,</hi> for above Twenty Five Years.
               But there was no time for such Reflections now, the Savage
               who was knock'd down recover'd himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I
               perceived that my Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l12" n="242"/> Piece at the
               Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my Savage, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l14">for so I call him now,</hi>
               made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I
               did, he no sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at
               one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1288l16">Germany,</hi> could
               have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who I had Reason
               to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except
               their own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
               Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so hard, that they will cut off
               Heads even with them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow too; when he had done this,
               he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and with
               abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down with the Head of the
               Savage, that he had kill'd just before me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1290">But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had kill'd the other Indian so
               far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go to him, so I bad him
               go, as well as I could, when he came to him, he stood like one amaz'd, looking at
               him, turn'd him first on one side, then on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet
               had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it had made a Hole, and no
               great Quantity of Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
               dead; He took up his Bow, and Arrows, and came back, so I
               turn'd to go away, and beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to him, that more
               might come after them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292">Upon this he sign'd to me, that he should bury them with Sand, that they might not be
               seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I made Signs again to him to do so; he fell
               to Work, and in an instant he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292l2" n="243"/> had scrap'd a
               Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragg'd
               him into it, and cover'd him, and did so also by the other; I believe he had bury'd
               them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry'd him not to my Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the
               farther Part of the Island; so I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1292l4">viz.</hi> That he came into my Grove for shelter.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1294">Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I
               found he was indeed in great Distress for, by his Running; and having refresh'd him,
               I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a
               great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my self
               sometimes; so the poor Creature laid down, and went to sleep.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296">He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made; with straight strong Limbs, not
               too large; tall and well shap'd, and as I reckon, about twenty six Years of Age. He
               had a very good Countenance, not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seem'd to have
               something very manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l2">European</hi> in his Countenance too, especially when he smil'd. His Hair was
               long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his Forehead very high, and large, and a great
               Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite
               black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l4">Brasilians,</hi> and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l6">Virginians,</hi> and other Natives of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l8">America</hi> are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable; tho' not very
               easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump; his Nose small, not flat like the
                  Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l10" n="244"/> fine Teeth well set, and white as Ivory. After
               he had slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he wak'd again, and comes
               out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I had in the Enclosure
               just by: When he espy'd me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the
               Ground, with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful Disposition, making a many
               antick Gestures to show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the Ground, close to
               my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done before; and after this,
               made all the Signs to me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let
               me know, how he would serve me as long as he liv'd; I understood him in many Things,
               and let him know, I was very well pleas'd with him; in a little Time I began to speak
               to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first, I made him know his Name should be
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l12">Friday,</hi> which was the Day I sav'd his Life; I call'd him so for the
               Memory of the Time; I likewise taught him to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1296l14">Master,</hi> and then let him
               know, that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say, YES, and NO, and to know
               the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him see me
               Drink it before him, and sop my Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do
               the like, which he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very good for
               him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298">I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to
               come with me, and let him know, I would give him some Cloaths, at which he seem'd
               very glad, for he was stark naked: As we went by the Place where he had bury'd the
               two Men, he pointed exactly to the Place, and shew'd me the Marks that he had made to
               find them again, making Signs to me, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298l2" n="245"/> that we
               should dig them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd very angry, express'd my
                  Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
               Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which he did
               immediately, with great Submission. I then led him up to the Top of the Hill, to see
               if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my Glass, I look'd, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but no appearance of them, or of their <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1298l4">Canoes</hi>; so that it was
               plain they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, without any search
               after them.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300">But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more Courage, and

                  release of the film "His Girl Friday" (1940), whose title alludes to Defoe's
                  novel.</note> with me, giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows
               at his Back, which I found he could use very dextrously, making him carry one Gun for
               me, and I two for my self, and away we march'd to the Place, where these Creatures
               had been; for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came
               to the Place, my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me, at
               the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at least it was so to
               me; though <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l5">Friday</hi> made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with humane
               Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood, great Pieces of Flesh left here and there,
               half eaten, mangl'd and scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant
               Feast they had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies: I saw three
               Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of
               other Parts of the Bodies; and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l7">Friday,</hi> by his Signs, made me understand,
               that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
               up, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1300l9" n="246"/> and that he, pointing to himself, was the
               fourth: That there had been a great Battle between them, and their next King, whose
               Subjects it seems he had been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners, all which were carry'd to several Places
               by those that had taken them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
               here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302">I caus'd <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302l2">Friday</hi> to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever
               remain'd, and lay them togethere on a Heap, and make a great
               Fire upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1302l4">Friday</hi> had still a
               hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in his Nature;

               he offer'd it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1304">When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell to work for my
               Man <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1304l2">Friday</hi>; and first of all, I gave him a pair of Linnen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I mention'd,
               and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little Alteration fitted him very
               well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I
               was now grown a tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a
               Hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was cloath'd for the
               present, tollerably well; and was mighty well pleas'd to see himself almost as well
               cloath'd as his Master: It is true, he went awkardly in these Things at first;
               wearing the Drawers was very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Wast-coat gall'd
               his Shoulders, and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he
               complain'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1304l4" n="247"/> they hurt him, and using himself
               to them, at length he took to them very well.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306">The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began to consider where I
               should lodge him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy my
               self; I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
               in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was a Door,
               or Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door Case, and a Door to it of
               Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing the
               Door to open on the inside, I barr'd it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so
               that <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306l2">Friday</hi> could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall,
               without making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my
               first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, covering all my Tent, and
               leaning up to the side of the Hill, which was again laid cross with smaller Sticks
                  instead of <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1306l4" target="laths_" corresp="laths">Laths</ref>
                                <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="laths" target="laths_" type="gloss">Thin, narrow strips of wood used to form a groundwork upon which to
                  fasten the slates of a roof</note>, and then thatch'd over a great Thickness, with
               the Rice Straw, which was strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left
               to go in or out by the Ladder, I had plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
                  attempted on the outside, would not have open'd at all,
               but would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, I took them
               all in to my Side every Night.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308">But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had
               a more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308l2">Friday</hi> was to me; without Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly
               oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections were ty'd to me,
               like those of a Child to a Father; and I dare say, he would have sacrific'd his Life
               for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1308l4" n="248"/> he gave me of
               this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1310">This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that however it
               had pleas'd God, in his Providence, and in the Government of the Works of his Hands,
               to take from so great a Part of the World of his Creatures, the best uses to which
               their Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow'd
               upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same Affections, the same Sentiments
               of Kindness and Obligation, the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs; the same
               Sense of Gratitude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and
               receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer to them
               Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the
               right Uses for which they were bestow'd, than we are; and this made me very
               melancholly sometimes, in reflecting as the several Occasions presented, how mean a
               Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of
               God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and why it has
               pleas'd God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many
               Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage, would make a much better
               use of it than we did.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312">From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312l2">Providence,</hi> and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
               Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and reveal it to
               others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut it up, and check'd my
               Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st.) That we <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1312l4" n="249"/>
               did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd; but that as God was
               necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy and Just, so it could
               not be; but that if these Creatures were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that Light which,
               as the Scripture says, was a Law to themselves, and by such
               Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge to be just, tho' the Foundation was not
               discover'd to us: And (2d.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the
               Potter, no Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou form'd me thus?</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1314">But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
                  Business to teach him every Thing, that was proper to
               make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make
               him speak, and understand me when I spake, and he was the aptest Schollar that ever
               was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased, when he
               cou'd but understand me, or make me understand him, that it
               was very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to be so easy, that I
               began to say to my self, that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared
               not, if I was never to remove from the place while I lived.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316">After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought that, in order to
               bring <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l2">Friday</hi> off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the Relish of a
               Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other Flesh; so I took him out with me
               one Morning to the Woods: I went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock,
               and bring him home and dress it. But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying down in
               the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her, I catch'd hold of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l4">Friday,</hi> hold says I, stand still; and made Signs to him
                  <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1316l6" n="250"/> not to stir, immediately I presented my
               Piece, shot and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature who had at a Distance
               indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how it
               was done, was sensibly surpriz'd, trembled, and shook, and
               look'd so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He
               did not see the Kid I shot at, or perceive I had kill'd it, but ripp'd up his
               Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently thought I was
               resolv'd to kill him; for he came and kneel'd down to me, and embraceing my Knees,
               said a great many Things I did not understand; but I could
               easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318">I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and taking him up by
               the Hand laugh'd at him, and pointed to the Kid which I had kill'd, beckoned to him
               to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how
               the Creature was kill'd, I loaded my Gun again, and by and
               by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318l2">Friday</hi> understand a little what I would do, I call'd him to me again,
               pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a Hawk, I
               say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let
               him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that
               Bird; according I fir'd and bad him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall, he
               stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had
               said to him; and I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see me put any
               Thing into the Gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and
               Destruction in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beast, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1318l4" n="251"/> Bird, or any Thing near, or far off; and the Astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear off
               for a long Time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp'd me
               and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would not so much as touch it for several Days
               after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learn'd of him, was to
               desire it not to kill him.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1320">Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and
               fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stay'd some Time; for the Parrot not
               being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good way off from the Place where she fell;
               however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceiv'd his
               Ignorance about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
               charge the Gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
               other Mark that might present; but nothing more offer'd at that Time; so I brought
               home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I
               could; and having a Pot for that purpose, I boil'd, or stew'd some of the Flesh, and
               made some very good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my Man,
               who seem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
               which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made a Sign to me,
               that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own Mouth, he seem'd
               to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water
               after it; on the other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I
               pretended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at the Salt;
               but it would not do, he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1320l2" n="252"/> would never care for
               Salt with his Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very
               little.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322">Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth, I was resolv'd to feast him the next
               Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did by hanging it before the Fire, in a
               String, as I had seen many People do in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322l2">England,</hi> setting two Poles up, one
               on each side the Fire, and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the
               Cross-stick, letting the Meat turn continually: This <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1322l4">Friday</hi> admir'd very much; but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so
               many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that I could not but understand him; and
               at last he told me he would never eat Man's Flesh any more, which I was very glad to
               hear.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1324">The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out, and sifting it in the manner
               I us'd to do, as I observ'd before, and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
               especially after he had seen what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to make
               Bread of; for after that I let him see me make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a
               little Time <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1324l2">Friday</hi> was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I could do
               it my self.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326">I begun now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead of one, I must
               provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity of Corn, than I us'd
               to do; so I mark'd out a larger Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner
               as before, in which <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326l2">Friday</hi> not only work'd very willingly, and very hard;
               but did it very chearfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for Corn to
               make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him,
               and my self too: He appear'd very sensible of that Part, and let me know, that he
               thought I had <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1326l4" n="253"/> much more Labour upon me on his
               Account, than I had for my self; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would
               tell him what to do.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328">This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328l2">Friday</hi>
               began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost every Thing I had
               occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to send him to, and talk'd a great
               deal to me; so that in short I began now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which
               indeed I had very little occasion for before; that is to say, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1328l4">about Speech</hi>;
               besides the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd Honesty,
               appear'd to me more and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and
               on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it was possible for him ever to love any
               Thing before.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1330">I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his own Country
               again, and having learn'd him <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1330l2">English</hi> so well that he could answer me almost
               any Questions, I ask'd him whether the Nation that he
               belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle, at which he smil'd; and said; yes, yes, we
               always fight the better; that is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we
               began the following Discourse: You always fight the better said I, How came you to be

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1358">By this I understood, that my Man <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1358l2">Friday</hi> had formerly been among the
               Savages, who us'd to come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island, on the same Man eating Occasions that he was now
               brought for; and sometime after, when I took the Courage to carry him to that Side,
                  being the same I formerly mention'd, he presently knew
               the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and
               one Child; he could not tell Twenty in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1358l4">English</hi>; but he numbred them by
               laying so many Stones on a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360">I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that after I had had
               this Discourse with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our Island to the Shore, and whether the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360l2">Canoes</hi> were not often lost; he told
               me, there was no Danger, no <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1360l4">Canoes</hi> ever lost; but that after a little way
               out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always one way in the Morning, the
               other in the Afternoon.</p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l2" n="255"/>This I understood to be no more than the Sets
               of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was
               occasion'd by the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l4">Oroonooko</hi>; in the Mouth, or the Gulph of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island lay; and this Land
               which I perceiv'd to the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l6">W.</hi> and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l8">N. W.</hi> was the great Island

                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l14">Friday</hi> a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the Sea,
               the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest
               Openness imaginable; I ask'd him the Names of the several
               Nations of his Sort of People; but could get no other Name
               than <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l16">Caribs</hi>; from whence I easily understood, that
               these were the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l18">Caribbees,</hi> which our Maps place on the Part of
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l20">America,</hi> which reaches from the Mouth of the River <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l22">Oroonooko</hi> to

               way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l28">W.</hi> from their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men, like me; and
               pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd before; and that they had kill'd
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l30">much Mans,</hi> that was his Word; by all which I understood, he meant the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l32">Spaniards,</hi> whose Cruelties in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1362l34">America</hi> had been spread over the
               whole Countries, and was remember'd by all the Nations from Father to Son.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364">I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island, and get among those
               white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364l2">in two Canoe</hi>; I could not
               understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364l4">two
                  Canoe,</hi> till at last with great Difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a
               large great Boat, as big as <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1364l6">two Canoes.</hi>

               to relish with me very well, and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one
               Time or other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place; and
               that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368">During the long Time that <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l2">Friday</hi> has now been with me, and that he began to
               speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly I ask'd him one Time who made him? The poor
               Creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had ask'd who was his Father;
               but I took it by another handle, and ask'd him who made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd
               on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it was one old <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l4">Benamuckee,</hi> that liv'd beyond all: He could describe nothing of this great
               Person, but that he was very old; much older he said than the Sea, or the Land; than
               the Moon, or the Stars: I ask'd him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why
               did not all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect Look of
               Innocence, said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l6">All Things do say O to him:</hi> I ask'd him if the People who
               die in his Country went away any where; he said, yes, they all went to <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1368l8" target="benamuckee_" corresp="benamuckee">Benamuckee</ref>

               I ask'd him whether these they eat up went thither too, he said yes.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370">From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of the true God: I told
               him that the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there, pointing up towards Heaven:
               That he governs the World by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it:
               That he was omnipotent, could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to us, take
               every Thing from us; and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes.
               He listned with great Attention, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l2" n="257"/> and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l4">Jesus
                  Christ</hi> being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making our Prayers to
               God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven; he told me one Day, that if our
               God could hear us up beyond the Sun, he must needs be a
               greater God than their <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l6">Benamuckee,</hi> who liv'd but a little way off, and yet
               could not hear, till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to
               him; I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never
               went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who he call'd their <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l8" target="oowocakee_" corresp="oowocakee">Oowocakee,</ref>

               explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l11">O,</hi>
               (so he called saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l13">Benamuckee</hi> said: By this I observ'd, That there is <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l15">Priestcraft,</hi>
               even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World;
               and the Policy of making a secret Religion, in order to
               preserve the Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not
               only to be found in the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1370l17">Roman,</hi> but perhaps among
               all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372">I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l2">Friday,</hi> and told him, that
               the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains, to say <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l4">O</hi> to their God
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l6">Benamuckee,</hi> was a Cheat, and their bringing Word from thence what he
               said, was much more so; that if they met with any Answer, or spake with any one
               there, it must be with an evil Spirit: And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil, the Original of him, his
               Rebellion against God, his Enmity to Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in
               the dark Parts of the World to be Worship'd instead of God,
               and as God; and the many Stratagems <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1372l8" n="258"/> he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruine; how he
               had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to adapt his Snares so to
               our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own Tempters, and to run upon our
               Destruction by our own Choice.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1374">I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his
               Mind about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my
                  Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity of a
               great first Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence, and
               of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us, and the like. But
               there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his
               Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor Creature puzzl'd
               me once in such a manner, by a Question meerly natural and innocent, that I scarce
               knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature to Sin, his
               being a consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity, how, as he had made us all, he
               could destroy us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great
               Seriousness to me all the while.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376">After this, I had been telling him how the Devil was God's
               Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
               Designs of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World; and the like.
               Well, says <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l2">Friday,</hi> but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much
               strong, much might as the Devil? Yes, yes, says I, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l4">Friday,</hi> God is stronger
               than the Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
               down under our Feet, <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l6" n="259"/> and enable us to resist
               his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l8">But,</hi> says he again, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1376l10">if God
                  much strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no
                  more do wicked?</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378">I was strangely surpriz'd at his Question, and after all, tho' I was now an old Man,
               yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough quallified for a Casuist, or a Solver of
               Difficulties: And at first I could not tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear
               him, and ask'd him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his
                  Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken
               Words, as above. By this time I had recovered my self a little, and I said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l2">God
                  will at last punish him severely</hi>; he is <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l4">reserv'd for the Judgment, and is
                  to be cast into the Bottomless-Pit, to dwell with everlasting Fire.</hi> This did not satisfie <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l6">Friday,</hi> but he returns upon
               me, repeating my Words, RESERVE, AT LAST, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l8">me no underderstand; but, Why not kill
                  the Devil now, not kill great ago?</hi> You may as well ask me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l10">said I,</hi>
               Why God does not kill you and I, when we do wicked Things here that offend him? We
               are preserv'd to repent and be pardon'd: He muses a while at this; <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l12">well,
                  well,</hi> says he, mighty affectionately, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l14">that well; so you, I, Devil, all
                     wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.</hi>
               Here I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testimony to me,
               how the meer Notions of Nature, though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the
               Consequence of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can from the Knowledge
               of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l16">Jesus Christ,</hi> and of a Redemption purchas'd for
               us, of a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-stool of
               God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form these in <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l18" n="260"/> the Soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our
               Lord and Saviour <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1378l20">Jesus Christ</hi>; I mean, the Word of God, and the Spirit of
               God promis'd for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People, are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the saving
               Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380">I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my
               Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending him
               for something a good way off, I seriously pray'd to God that he would enable me to
               instruct savingly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit
               the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the Light of the Knowledge of God
               in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l2">Christ,</hi> reconciling him to himself, and would
               guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God, as his Conscience might be
               convinc'd, his Eyes open'd, and his Soul sav'd. When he came again to me, I entred
               into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the
               Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd from Heaven,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l4">viz.</hi> of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Blessed Lord
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l6">Jesus.</hi> I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our Blessed
               Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l8">Abraham,</hi> and
               how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption; that he came
               only to the lost Sheep of the House of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1380l10">Israel,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382">I had, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l2">God knows,</hi> more Sincerity than Knowledge, in
               all the Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must acknowledge
               what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find, That in laying Things
               open to him, I really inform'd and instructed my self in many Things, that either I
               did not know, or had not fully consider'd <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l4" n="261"/>
               before; but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind, upon my searching into them, for the
               Information of this poor Savage; and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things
               upon this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild Wretch
               was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be thankful that ever he came to
               me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond
               Measure; and when I reflected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd
               to, I had not only been moved my self to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand
               that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to
               save the Life, and <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l6">for ought I knew,</hi> the Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of Religion, and
               of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1382l8">to know whom is Life
                     eternal.</hi> I say, when I reflected upon all these
               Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I frequently rejoyc'd
               that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful
               of all Afflictions that could possibly have befallen me.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384">In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my
               Time, and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l2">Friday</hi> and I,
               was such, as made the three Years which we liv'd there together perfectly and
               compleatly happy, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l4">if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form'd in a
                     sublunary State.</hi> The Savage was now a good
                  Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to
               hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd
               Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to
               instruct, than if we had been in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1384l6">England.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l2" n="262"/>I always apply'd my self in Reading the
                  Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
               Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious
               Enquiries, and Questionings, made me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l4">as I said before,</hi> a much better
               Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have been by my own private
               meer Reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing
               here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part of my Life,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l6">viz.</hi> How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing
               it is, that the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1386l8">Christ Jesus,</hi> is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy
               to be receiv'd and understood: That as the bare reading the
               Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly on
               to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in Practice,
               and Obedience to all God's Commands, and this without any Teacher or Instructer; I mean, humane; so the same plain
               Instruction sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this
               Savage Creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal
               to him in my Life.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388">As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife and Contention, which has happen'd in the
               World about Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government,
               they were all perfectly useless to us; as for ought I can
               yet see, they have been to all the rest of the World: We had the <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l2">sure Guide</hi>
               to Heaven, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l4">viz.</hi> The Word of God; and we had, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1388l6">blessed be God,</hi>

            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390">After <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l2">Friday</hi> and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
               fluently, though in broken <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l4">English</hi> to me; I acquainted him with my own Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into
               the Place, how I had liv'd there, and how long. I let him into the Mystery, for such
               it was to him, of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to shoot: I gave him a
               Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made
               him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, such as in <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l6">England</hi> we wear <ref id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1390l8" target="hanger_" corresp="hanger">Hangers</ref>

               which was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392">I describ'd to him the Country of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392l2">Europe,</hi> and particularly <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1392l4">England,</hi>
               which I came from; how we liv'd, how we worshipp'd God, how we behav'd to one
               another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World: I gave him an Account
               of the Wreck which I had been on board of, and shew'd him as near as I could, the
               Place where she lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394">I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd, and which I could
               not stir with my whole Strength then; but was now fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon
               seeing this Boat, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394l2">Friday</hi> stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I
               ask'd him what it was he study'd upon, at last says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1394l4">me see such Boat like
                  come to Place at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396">I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examin'd farther into
               it, I understood <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396l2" n="264"/> by
               him, that a Boat, such as that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he
               liv'd; that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I
               presently imagin'd, that some <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1396l4">European</hi> Ship must have been cast away upon
               their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive a Shore; but was so dull, that I
               never once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither, much less whence they
               might come; so I only enquir'd after a Description of the
               Boat.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398">
               <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l2">Friday</hi> describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me better to
               understand him, when he added with some Warmth, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l4">we save
                  the white Mans from drown:</hi> Then I presently ask'd him, if there was any <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l6">white Mans,</hi> as he call'd them, in the Boat;
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l8">yes,</hi> he said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l10">the Boat full white Mans:</hi> I ask'd him how many; he
               told upon his Fingers seventeen: I ask'd him then what become of them; he told me,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1398l12">they live, they dwell at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1400">This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd, that these might be the
               Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away in Sight of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1400l2">my Island,</hi> as I
               now call it; and who after the Ship was struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had sav'd themselves in their Boat, and were
               landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402">Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically, What was become of them? He assur'd me
               they lived still there; that they had been there about four
               Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them Victuals to live. I ask'd him,
               How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them? He said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l2">No, they make
                  Brother with them</hi>; that is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added,
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l4">They no eat Mans but when make the War fight</hi>; that is to <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1402l6" n="265"/> say, they never eat any Men but such as come to fight
               with them, and are taken in Battle.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404">It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of the Hill, at the
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l2">East</hi> Side of the Island, from whence as I have said, I had in a clear Day
               discover'd the Main, or Continent of <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l4">America; Friday,</hi> the Weather being very
               serene, looks very earnestly towards the Main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls
               a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance from him: I
               ask'd him, What was the Matter? <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l6">O joy!</hi> Says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1404l8">O glad! There see my
                  Country, there my Nation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406">I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in
               his Face, and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness,
               as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and this Observation of mine, put
               a great many Thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new Man
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406l2">Friday</hi> as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1406l4">Friday</hi>
               could get back to his own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion,
               but all his Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Countrymen an
               Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or two
               of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he us'd to be
               with those of his Enemies, when they were taken in War.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1408">But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very much, for which I was very sorry
               afterwards. However as my Jealousy encreased, and held me some Weeks, I was a little
               more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
               certainly in the Wrong too, the honest grateful Creature
               having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best Principles, both <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1408l2" n="266"/> as a religious Christian, and as a grateful
               Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1410">While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every Day pumping him to see
               if he would discover any of the new Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found every thing he said was so Honest, and so Innocent,
               that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and in spight of all my Uneasiness
               he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the
               least perceive that I was Uneasie, and therefore I could not
               suspect him of Deceit.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412">One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being haizy at Sea, so that we
               could not see the Continent, I call'd to him, and said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l2">Friday,</hi> do not you wish your self in your own Country, your own Nation? Yes, he said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l4">he be much O glad to
                  be at his own Nation.</hi> What would you do there said I, would you turn Wild
               again, eat Mens Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before. He lookt full of
               Concern, and shaking his Head said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l6">No no,</hi> Friday <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l8">tell them to live
                  Good,</hi> tell them <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l10">to pray God,</hi> tell them <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l12">to eat Corn-bread,
                  Cattle-flesh, Milk, no eat Man again</hi>: Why then said I to him, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l14">They will
                  kill you.</hi> He look'd grave at that, and then said, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l16">No, they no kill me,
                  they willing love learn</hi>: He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
               added, they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans that come in the Boat. Then I ask'd him
               if he would go back to them? He smil'd at that, and told me he could not swim so far.
               I told him I would make a <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l18">Canoe</hi> for him. He told me, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l20">he would go, if I
                  would go with him.</hi> I go! says I, why they will Eat me if I come there? No,
               no, says he, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l22">me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you:</hi> He meant
               he would tell them how I had kill'd his Enemies, and sav'd his Life, and so he <pb id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1412l24" n="267"/> would make them love me; then he told me as
               well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White-men, or Bearded-men, as he
               call'd them, who came on Shore there in Distress.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414">From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly
               joyn with these Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l2">Spaniards</hi> or
                  <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l4">Portuguese</hi>; not doubting but if I could we might find some Method to
               Escape from thence, being upon the Continent, and a good Company together; better
               than I could from an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without Help. So after
               some Days I took <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1414l6">Friday</hi> to work again, by way of Discourse, and told him I
               would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and accordingly I carry'd him to
               my Frigate which lay on the other Side of the Island, and having clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it sunk in the Water; I brought it out,
               shewed it him, and we both went into it.</p>
            <p id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416">I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it, would
               make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said to
               him, Well now, <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l2">Friday,</hi> shall we go to your Nation?
               He look'd very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he thought the Boat
               too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next Day I went to the
               Place where the first Boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into
               Water: He said that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
               lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun had split and dry'd it, that it was
               in a manner rotten. <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l4">Friday</hi> told me such a Boat would do very well, and would
               carry <hi id="PD2743N2l5l4l2l1416l6">much enough Vittle, Drink, Bread,</hi> that was his Way of Talking.</p>
